We need just one of these plants to be the target of a succesful terror attack, in a war zone, be badly managed because of budget cuts or corruption to change all this. This is also why these plants are uninsurable because no company can underwrite the value of an entire city.

Certainly, I won't be giving up on the Migrator sub (just avoiding other reddit subs), but I've said what needed to be said and shall be moving on. Stellar lifting -my word, how that model could be considered remotely more feasible than asteroid mining is beyond me. Apparently to propose asteroid mining fits the data is 'crackpot' and 'away with the fairies', but having vast platforms 'coaxing' coronal mass from the star's blistering heliosphere, then streaming it like a 'sprinkler' millions of miles to a habitable zone (not that you'd need one if capable of such technology) is 'just engineering' ! Though I've had no input from the astrophysics community, I have from engineers with whom I've consulted on the physics of the asteroid milling platforms. It's time to move on, I need to focus on getting my second book out and some kind of abstract the astrophysics community can engage with. This just means I'll be making less posts here, but please keep visiting because the model has immense implications if the signifiers I propose gain weight as being credible. Because they are associated directly with the activity (asteroid mining), this is what I propose the (proposed) ETI signal says...

*""Look, we're flagging up the symmetry of our harvesting operation through mathematical affirmation routes. Why would we do that rather than send telecommunications? Obviously a telecommunication warning specific to asteroid mining would have to be detected and deciphered (which could take centuries, assuming the vast signal was downloaded without blips) -there must be urgency implied by our signal. There is: a single asteroid can impact a mother world with the force of one billion megatons leading to species extinction, we've seen it (or barely survived it ourselves) before. To avoid sowing gravitational entropy in the wider asteroid belt, follow our example of a clean systematic sectorial operation. This is our* ***siren warning*** *to the galaxy.""*

This song, which I use as a kind of ambassador for the proposed ETI signal, says it all with a few playful change of words - *'...what a warning - you will weep for the rocks and mountains, when the asteroids begin to fall.' †*

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmHwtodPuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmHwtodPuI)

† Note the warning is not one regarding ***a lack of intelligence*** when it comes to asteroid mining, any species capable of reaching the belt and harvesting the rocks will know there could be potentially apocalyptic consequences if bungled, the warning regards a ***biological flaw*** in any species comprised of members with relatively limited life spans to prioritise immediate profit regardless of the long term impact.

The EU office of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was similarly scathing, calling the proposal a ""fiasco"" and ""political stitch-up"" that will create a ""huge mess"" in the financial markets. WWF also accused the Commission of bowing down to pressure from France and its pro-nuclear allies.

No, it's the natural response to hypocrisy.

If I point out that predictions made in the 90s have already turned out to be false, I get downvoted.  If I point out studies I've read that show that past temperature readings were inaccurate, and usually lower than than the actual figures, due to the placement of thermometers and how they estimated so much data, I get downvoted.  If I point out how tiny the time window spans of climate change data is, I get downvoted.  Climate change has been politically charged to the point that people who don't understand any of it speak with confidence as if they suddenly have a science degree.

Same for anti-Trumpisms.  I factually pointed out that migrants took the jobs where I grew up, got downvoted to hell and told that they can't steal jobs and no one wanted the jobs, blah blah blah.  OK, but suddenly everyone in certain jobs where I'm from are from Mexico and they will no longer hire you unless you speak Spanish, and we are over 1000 miles from Mexico, so that's BS, but OK, the migrants have nothing to do with the lack of job openings where I'm from.

I point out how supposedly nice liberal policies fail in my city (NYC) and get downvoted to hell.  But the downvote doesn't change reality.  Prices for everything adjusted up when we raised our minimum wage, but some stores also closed, we have many empty storefronts here, and only chain stores are opening, because they're the only ones who can afford the PTO rule and insurance requirements and taxes and regulations and minimum wage rules here.

You are essentially saying that alex jones should never have been questioned about his beliefs? Cause you obviously didnt listen to his interview.

Name another interviewer who gives prominent scientists in their field as much time to speak as him? 


Just because he isnt a hypocritical pawn of the mass media and speaks his actual mind because he thinks about how he actually feels about something rather than repeat whatever thing the corporation requires him to say doesnt make him less of a journalist than anyone on CNN, fox, MSNBC, or even npr for that matter.

I live in Australia. While there isn't a fire close to me (the nearest one was 20km away, and burnt for a week early December), I haven't seen blue skies since October.

I have lost one friend to these fires last week (heart attack while helping one of his mates fight a fire on his property at the other end of the state); another friend lost his rural 'retirement' property to one of the earlier fires back in November, and I've spent the last 6 weeks or so looking after his house, garden and pets while he's been up north clearing the rubble from his burnt-out place.

In my lifetime in Australia, I have - until this summer - only experienced a handful of days above the 100'F/37'C level. I have had more days this summer over that mark than I have had in the 47 years previous. What is absurd though is the number of days in the high 40s - something I'd never experience before now, but we've had 4 or 5 just this summer.

Australia, despite its recent history of changing Prime Ministers quite rapidly, recently changed the rules for deposing a PM, and its just as well they did, because the vitriol the current incumbent attracts is unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime - and I am a political historian by training. He's a climate change denialist, and has displayed a level of incompetence, denial, lack of empathy and cluelessness probably not seen in a head of government since Ceausescu. The hatred for him and his ruling clique is so strong I rate it about a 30% chance that we will see the emergence of a violent eco-terrorist movement in Australia inside three years.

Prior to this season, I have always been a bit on-the-quiet about my ""insurance preparations"". My best friend knows, and my son knows. But noone else. Not for any security reason, but I kept it under my hat because it seemed a bit tin-foily and crack-pot. Now, it's a regular topic of conversation. I have several friends making similar plans - no idea if they were doing so before, but now it's out in the open. And they're coming to me for advice. Good. I'm telling them which area, locally, we should be aiming to acquire setups in, and sharing ideas.

I lived on a permaculture experimental-agriculture farm in my 20s (early 90s), so I've known for a long time we'd face some kind of enviro-apocalypse.

&gt; TBF, he might be an honest climate sceptic (and have come to this conclusion after reading 200 book and having 'thought about it a lot TM' but his critiques are climate change issue are not novel, he strawmans any opposition, bases 'his ideas' on old debunked theories concocted by CRACKPOTS (geniuses in Peterson's own words), and he gives these ideas the extremely valuable (to the big end of town, whether Peterson gets a cut or not), maybe they just by a couple of truck worth of his books for compensation (obvious speculation, don't ask for proof) 'Peterson stamp of intellectual authority' which helps to legitimise and spread the 'argument' (justification for apathy/inaction) and plant them in the mind of a young voting age demographic who may otherwise care about climate change, but hate the SJW;s, and the Marxists, Post Modernists, Trans people, and anyone else they can label as a whinging SJW who is trying to spoil their fun and take their 'hard earned' and fair and rightful share of the world's resources the deserve as proportionate compensation for the value they alone as an individual have brought to the world (Don't include negative externalities in the equation though, that's some Post-Modernist, Marxist, insert whatever pejorative that makes you happy or sound smart, and helps you sleep. How dare they suggest I give up a fraction of what's mine it to someone less deserving than me, and god help anyone who tries to actually do it through policy reform/ tax rate adjustments/ carbon taxes etc. But I don't care about other taxes that don't negatively affect me directly, and hurt the most vulnerable (least deserving by natural order because something something lobsters). Now as an informed and obviously intelligent citizen (having read 12 rules for life qualifies me to that self appraisal, and 'understanding' Maps of meaning means I'm a freaking genius, plus I've got a pocket full of $5 words to spend if any doubts me or makes me doubt myself, but like many people with a little wealth, they don't quite know how to spend in a way that is concidered genuine to those with a little more wealth. Be Careful throwing around $5 words when you're not sure what the social value of doing so is, not aimed at you specifically OP, just a general piece of advice to cocksure young men).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, off to the polls I go to ensure my vote counts and the chances of the things I (Peterson et al.) want increase accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; So they'll ignore the climate change issue (or let it slide, perhaps with some other things they find hard to swallow), or give him a pass on that one because he has so much more of value to say. Then at election time they go to the polls and vote with Peterson having influenced their political priorities (and fucking identities in some cases). Of course it's not 'that simple' and I'm not suggesting everyone who reads the TL;DR on wiki, or buys his book, or donates to Patreon are all the same and behave the same. But I will say this, any one who thinks they're immune to the effects of propaganda are literally delusional and have a fuck load of hard and possibly painful work to do, and they certainly should not be relying on one (or a few) sources of information to do this.
&gt; 
&gt; A real education is a good foundation, which Peterson also devalues unless it's STEM with high income potential in an increasingly competitive and over-populated field, though He does value the trades (but who doesn't, besides a few boomers who wanted better for their children), so I'll give him credit there (but tradies aren't formally  trained to think critically enough to see through and oppose him, so of course he likes them).

&gt; Perhaps the democrats really do have a problem accepting facts. 

&gt; So you believe congress just passed an unnecessary billion dollar emergency funding bill for fun? You seem smarter than that. 

See: the two links that you ignored, it shows the opposite in both cases. Dems voted for bills in both houses allowing more aid because they can't directly control conditions. The Dem bill required conditions improved for the children with funds to help it pass. GOP bill gave no standards for care improvement and even had a rider for funds for Pentagon. I'd love to see how you spin that.

&gt; They wouldn't be there if congress hadn't passed the laws that Trump is enforcing. They wouldn't be there if there were less lawbreakers trying to game the system. There are a lot of scenarios. I don't accuse you of lying because you don't list them all.

Well thanks for not accusing me of lies whilst lying. When I said pre-Trump, I said it because of Trump. I meant what I said. Trump in April 2018 changed civil charges to criminal and detained asylum seekers. That wasn't through Congress. Trump changed protocol to allow detention of those who would not have been detained, and in doing so he created a legal violation through Flores. Congress got involved until Trump promised to not detain over the 20day deadline, but Trump's still doing it. Trump by rule is not ""enforcing"" the law, he changed DoJ policy and ended up VIOLATING the law.

&gt; if conjunction

It is what he said, it's what he's been saying, it's even what his team has been saying. Just a tip, this is a poor time to double down on the ""if"" as if Trump hasn't been calling conditions good if not perfect, given the Pence video from last night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B29-zYvMdAE&amp;feature=youtu.be Enjoy Pence saying to the press that ""each and every one of the children... and parents that I spoke to told me they were being treated well"" just after coming out of camps of 400 people packed with little space and lots of stench, and his own OIG report listing conditions failures.

End of discussion.

&gt;If a man has a certain reaction to a woman's behavior and other men share that sentiment then together they share that perspective.

Yes, they do. Many people share the perspective that black people are inferior beings, etc. That doesn't make them correct if they cannot back up their views in any valid way. You could state that a woman who was a virgin was a slut and then if men agreed on it then you would argue that it then has validity. It doesn't have validity.

&gt;I feel like our perspectives on dating and sleeping around in the 'contemporary climate' is different. I have female friends that go on a lot of dates, but don't sleep around. They take their dating lives seriously and often end up in LTRs. I also have female friends that are technically not slutting it up because they are having sex within the context of a 'relationship'. However, because they have a string of these short relationships it damages their reputation. I know a girl that every time I see her every few weeks she has a new boyfriend. It reached a point where I don't bother learning the names of these guys because the trend shows that they won't last. Her behavior has damaged her reputation in our social circle, and guys that know her as friends are less willing to take her seriously from what I hear.

Go to the top rated comment [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/5mz753/cmv_slut_shaming_is_primarily_a_f2f_issue/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=PurplePillDebate). Notice that the only RPer that responded to that was a woman because most RPers are too immature to take responsibility for their actions when they have real world consequences. They'd rather continue with their bullshit internet circle jerk.

&gt;The reason women are punished for this situation is because they are the ones that get hurt in these situations.

This is a ridiculous argument coming from anyone. But when it comes from RPers, who also advocate men sleeping around and avoiding commitment, while also claiming that they're somehow saving society by slut shaming, then it becomes literally absurd.

What you are effectively saying is that men should be rewarded for misleading women and women should be punished for being misled. And then RPers wonder why they're considered misogynists!

&gt;The argument that it's not an achievement is not used to refute the position that it is an achievement for women. It is used to support the argument that n-count/casual sex impacts women's and men's reputation differently.

Yes, but it's a bad argument because women extremely rarely set out with the intention of notching their bedpost in the first place. Women do not think it is an achievement to sleep around and they don't value it. So it therefore makes no sense to make this argument. It is spurious.

&gt;Because that is a personal standard, that is shaped by personal tastes and experience.

If you cannot reasonably agree on or even define something then the whole concept of referring to it as unhealthy is invalidated. Why is this unhealthy? Because I say that it is. What evidence do you have that it's unhealthy? None! Brilliant argument!

&gt;This dynamic is a little polarized, but in my experience it is pretty accurate. I hope my perspective will make sense to you when I contextualize it. The kind of advances people are talking about when it comes to plate-spinning and abundance mentality are low effort. Women that come to nightclubs and hook up with a guy who has attempted the same approach with 20 other girls in the same nightclub, does not create a valuable interaction for herself. In the eyes of a man that really like her this girl's value is downgraded from 'I should take her out to a nice dinner and that stuck-up bar that I don't really like but girls love it when you take them there' to 'I just have to say whatever that guy she's never met before said in a nightclub'. On the contrary high-value women will not accept this low effort approach, and for me that was a very frustrating lesson to learn. That when you reach a certain level being a player can actually be a detriment to getting into a relationship with a woman you really respect and desire. It doesn't mean she is only into chads, but she is not down to be with a guy who hits on everything that moves.

Slut shaming is a socially fabricated concept. Sex has no value other than what you afford it. Sex is arguably the most normal of all human behaviours, its why you're here and childbirth occurs in the first place. One might reasonably wonder why a demonised, filthy, taboo act leads to life itself. 

Yet, naturally enough, everyone wants to have sex. So you are invalidating something which is perfectly natural and merely following irrational dogma which has existed since human beings had all sorts of absurd beliefs that we would now view as laughable.

Sex is the number one underlying factor for human interaction, and absolutely the number one underlying component of dating. To ascribe people with a low valuation because they have sex is merely a superstition and in the cold light of day is completely lacking in logic.

&gt;I don't think it's shaming for sharing your personal preferences, that is taking it a little too far.

I have said over and over again that people's preferences are their own preferences and no-one can change that. I never made any statement about people's preferences. This has nothing to do with slut shaming, which is...

[A form of social stigma applied to people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate traditional expectations for sexual behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming).

Disregarding the trouble it would mean forming a government this time, I can't see that as more/less problematic for them apart from the optics of being seen as switching back and forth.

The switch C did cost them a lot, but I think that was mostly because they had a lot of rural support to lose. SD then became the rural opposition party and C lost more than half their support in many rural areas.

Many of us voted L in the 2018 election \*because\* they pledged not to support or be part of a government that required SD support. I'd very much like them to return to that pledge again, but unlike C they probably can't afford it at this point because with their <5% support they can't shed any voters who want L to be part of a right wing government. Basically: their votes are torn apart by mostly social-liberal voters (progressives) like me, and primarily economic liberals.

The worse part is that for unknown reason garbage collectors usually mix metal, plastic, glass and paper in a single truck. Why they do that is beyond me but oh well, at least they annoyed some people in the process by forcing them to keep 5 bins at home.

My favourite example of how annoying that is is cleaning up after having a pizza. You have to throw the crust into biodegradable bin, but if there's any meat left you have to pick it first and put in the rest bin. Then, you have to tear out all oily paper and put it in the rest bin as well, only then you can throw dry parts into a paper bin.

Possessing and Buy are two different things. The US has a large hunting culture. Not going to change nor do American want to stop fathers and sons from hunting together and promoting a positive gun culture.

&gt; It only took forever despite broad support after largest gun massacre in US history. 

Its unconstitutional how it was banned it will be overturned, Presidents don't have the power nor should to make laws 

Edit: power

&gt; So not meaningless at all

Round limits do not make a weapon more or less deadly. NY, NJ, CA have had no less crimes or decrease in deaths via guns since there attempts at banning Mag sizes

&gt; Says the gun nut, you have a bias

Stating facts 
https://reason.com/blog/2018/12/20/new-jerseys-gun-owners-do-not-seem-eager

Its settled until the Supreme Court gets involved. Which most likely they will not, meaning that Magazine size limits are unconstitutional 

&gt; You can own a .50 cal gun

So? Never heard of someone using it to commit a crime. Based on your logic 9mm should be banned first as they kill more than another other round. I don't see that happening: see the above about Americans not wanting Handguns bans

&gt; Irrelevant to fact its easy to do

Completely relevant, because no one has ever used a AR15 illegal modified to commit a crime. I can make almost any semi-automatic gun automatic with the right tool and know-how. So do you want a full ban on all semi-automatic based on the logic? Because guess what Americans don't: again see above data.

&gt; Its the massacres that are routine which drive people wanting gun control

Knee jerk reactions to events are not a good way to govern a nation. That is why the founding father made it hard to amend the constitution and make laws.

I do not care about other nations. Im American, what works there may or does not work here. Again see above most Americans do not want bans.

&gt; Democrats organized the initiative dating back to kyoto protocol, why lie?

The Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement are two different treaties about global warming. Both of which were started by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, that isn't a lie, its fact. Democrats may support these treaties but they didn't organize them, the UN did. 

&gt; They did, republicans wanted to place sand bags in satellites taking pictures of the effects of climate change, entirely a dem effort thats succeeded despite republicans.

Knowing only one side of the story is not the issue. Even people who know about the other side of the story stick to beliefs that are in line with their political perspective. In fact, among Republicans, the ones who are most informed about scientific issues, the ones who read stuff about science and show high scientific literacy on non-climate questions, are no less skeptical about anthropogenic climate change being a serious concern than their less-informed brethren. You would expect that educated and scientifically literate Republicans would be more likely to have encountered arguments and evidence for climate change, so if climate change denial is due to lack of information, you would expect they would be less skeptical. But this is not what we see. 

Polarization on the issue is not primarily due to lack of information or one-sided information. It is due to the fact that beliefs have become signals of political identity, and people who are deeply attached to a particular political identity conform their beliefs to fit that identity, even if they are fully aware of the arguments on the other side.

If you want to research this yourself, search for the ""knowledge deficit model"" or ""information deficit model"" on Google Scholar. That is essentially the model you are advocating -- that climate denialism is primarily a consequence of lacking relevant information. You will find that the vast majority of contemporary scholarship on the issue rejects this model when it comes to views about climate change. So, ironically, in advocating the information deficit model you yourself are going against the scientific consensus. [Here](http://blog.nature.org/science/2013/03/01/dan-kahan-climate-changescience-communications/) is an article to get you started.

&gt; Clearly, climate change is associated with the left wing media so the more right wing person is, the more likely they are to dismiss it as liberal propaganda or some such. 

Right, but you initially said that the problem is ""Nobody really even tried to explain to them how it works and how we can know it is true."" The thing is, a lot of articles *do* explain this, but, as you said, they are dismissed by conservatives as liberal propaganda. And this is not just about news articles. Climate scientists get dismissed as liberal propagandists too. Because the issue is so politicized, it's not a simple matter of explaining how it works, because anyone who tries to do that will get identified as a political operative.

&gt; News outlets are more of a marketplace of bullshit narratives...

The whole point of the ""marketplace of ideas"" concept is that if everyone has the freedom to disseminate their own arguments and ideas, then competition between these ideas will lead to the best ideas becoming commonly accepted while the worst ones get rejected.

But if you believe that news outlets are a marketplace of bullshit narratives, then you are implicitly conceding that this idealistic ""marketplace of ideas"" concept doesn't work. If the mainstream media has realized that what sells is not good ideas and honest information but sensationalized bullshit, then *that is what the marketplace produces and supports*.

&gt; anyways what is your better alternative to marketplace of ideas?

I don't have a fully worked out alternative, but you don't need to have an alternative to point out the flaws in a pre-existing concept.
Here's a vague recommendation, though: 

Certain kinds of policy decisions are crucially dependent on scientific knowledge. Climate policy is a good example. I think decisions of that sort should be more insulated from the vagaries of democratic politics, and more in the hands of properly credentialed experts than elected politicians. Perhaps when it comes to science-related policy-making, elected officials should only be able to vote on ""if... then..."" policies, that say things like ""If the science says X, then do this; if it says Y, then do this; etc."" Once that bill is passed, experts get to decide which of the ""if"" clauses is accurate and enact the corresponding policy. This means politicians don't make judgments about what the science says, only about how we should respond if the science says a particular thing. A politician who is currently a global warming skeptic may still agree that *if* anthropogenic global warming is a serious issue, *then* we should curb carbon emissions. It would be up to experts to decide whether or not global warming is actually a serious issue.",0,,

**Let me make this clear, in the midst of the death and carnage and anger from the electorate on so many incompetent acts that they are more concerned with their popularity than with responsible governance.**

**How is it appropriate that as this disaster unfolds the LNP decided to respond with psychological warfare to anger and deceive the Australian community with this toxic disinformation campaign?**

During a climate change disaster, this climate change denying Govt has embarked on a disinformation campaign on facebook etc coupled with some assistance from the Murdoch press spreading this disinformation.

I am flabbergasted this not front page news that should end the Government.

Australians are just starting to realise that there has been odd behavior on their social media platforms in the last couple weeks and its attributed to an intensive election style Cambridge Analytica rote psychological warfare and this has been widely documented. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/08/australia-where-lies-and-conspiracy-theories-spread-like-bushfire

How's that for a non-answer that confirms our suspicions. FYI Topham Guerin have a track record of assisting state and federal Liberal Party campaigns, they are the goto guys for their campaigning and no doubt are directly or through an intermediary they are behind this.

It's also true in the really vile underlying sense when it comes to the consciousness you get from reality shows. 

Everything's simple, clear cut, based on vague stereotypes and archetypes that ""feel"" true. 

Truth or ""truthiness"" is based on who does the best sick burns to ""own the libs"" or is the toughest to go after the freaks and lazy bums and bad guys. 

Categorizing and boxing people into groups and tribes which can then be collectively judged or set against each other is necessary for both reality TV and reactionary politics to remain understandable; as is a collective mockery and denigration of the otherized as scary, alien, dangerous, freakish and degenerate.

Social values are boiled down to basic, moralistic, arbitrary, authoritarian structures; wear the right clothes and talk the way I want you to and don't have a tattoo, or Judge Judy will immediately find you suspect, etc. There is no meaningful appeal, hierarchy justifies itself simply by existing. 

Hypocrisy doesn't matter; in the same way that a regular schlub can take solace in laughing at the ""trash"" on Steve Wilkos while not being far removed from that social perception themselves, reactionary entertainers/politicos can scream about morals and traditional society while breaking all those principles in their own personal case and no one will care, as long as the correct hated groups are targeted by them. 

Truth is whatever needs to be true at the time, even if contradictory truths are needed; in the same way that reality TV is mostly ""reality"" TV, reactionary politicians who provide entertainment, representation and cultural relief for their constituencies don't need to tell the truth. They need to say something that *feels like the truth* to their intended audience. Does the stereotypical reality TV family behave how I think they should? Okay, seems pretty real. Same goes for the pols saying climate change is fake because it snowed. To their audience, that feels real- and that's all that matters, because....

There's a sense that this whole thing is a game and a big fucking joke anyway. Just like in reality TV, no one *really* takes it seriously. Everyone knows, on some level, that the ""reality"" being presented isn't complete, and that's in the best of times. But why care when they're entertaining you and pissing off the people you hate? 

I could go on about the parallels between common reality TV formats and the populist variant of far-right politics, but think about people like Ted Cruz, MTG, Trump, DeSantis, et al and you'll see how well they line up, I think. 

TL:DR I genuinely think that modern reactionary social politics is basically the Maury Show-ification of social ideology mixed with bigotry.

ohmygod buddy you seriously need to look up the severity of Climate Change caused due to Livestock, please inform yourself about the impact of the things you are speaking of, Industrial revolution seriously? Humans have been eating meat for millennia that is true but not trillions of animals every single year are they? do you think factory farms existed years ago? the reason why it didn't cause a problem millennia ago us because the volume was unbelievably insignificant, please I request you to look into this before speaking about it, don't be ignorant about such a huge thing.

Unnecessarily Paying for the murder/rape/torture and slaughter of animals everyday simply for something as irrelevant as your tastebuds is quite an unethical stance Idk where do you come from but this is how I see it.

I am against eating/drinking something because I do not want to cause harm to any animal whatsoever, thr realisation had dawned upon me when I would feed and love every dog around me including my own, fight for them when someone hit them or tortured them yet I ate meat and consumed animal products, I realised that I was being harshly hypocritical because those animals whose deaths I paid for experienced the same joy as my dogs do, want to be loved the same way my dogs do and would do anything to survive just like how my dogs do, hence I stopped committing the things I used to, simple.

Also ethical slaughter is an oxymoron btw

It might well be that nuclear is not the large part of the solution to climate change as it is now, and perhaps just because new nuclear plants are prohibitively expensive to build, but that simply doesn't in any way whatsoever justify ruling nuclear as unsustainable. Consider that when you make a policy decision like this you aren't just deciding about options as they are now, you are also considering them for an extremely wide range of possible other political and technological developments. You have to take all possible scenarios into account when making policy. Again this decisions simply isn't about whether nuclear is a solution to climate change.

Realistically, how does that work? Any products his farm produced would be vastly more expensive than anyone else's. He'd give up his slaves, lose his wealth and influence, and end up a morally upstanding person who was no longer of consequence. The dude died in *massive* debt, so if he gave up his slaves and all his property, he'd have been destitute and likely wind up debtor's prison, basically a slave himself.    
  
I agree it'd have been great for his slaves. It very likely would have made no difference on the grand scale except to take away Jefferson's platform.   
    
It strikes me as kind of ignorant, at best, to not consider the facts here. You condemn Jefferson as being a hypocrite for being against slavery yet not freeing his slaves.    
How about *you* though? You use computers, smart phones, and other products which are almost certainly made with some form of forced labor.

That's a false dichotomy. There is plenty of middle ground between naked consumerism and death. I don't expect people to be perfect, because I most certainly am not.

Check the graphs about LCOE (utility-scale) \[Levelized cost of electicity\]. Solar has been for years comparable with Fossil fuels. The main problems are 1) We are talking about converting *huge* shares of the power market, that doesn't happen in a year or two. 2) Small yield in winter season. 3) At some point we'll have to compromise and accept fossils to balance the grid or invest heavily in storage systems.

Nothing wrong with saying Solar isn't perfect, but saying it doesn't work and it's just greenwashing is bad and very lazy propaganda. It needed subsidies in the past (and the very high LCOE of 10-15 years ago proves it). Doesn't mean it can't survive without it now. But subsidies do accelerate things and many companies prefer constant and sure revenues, so they are welcome.

And since this thread is about Nuclear: Yes Nuclear's LCOE is even lower (huge costs but also huge power production). So I'm in favour of it.

You mention that only .5% of the country works for the military, but it isn't about getting people to just join the military; it's about getting people to work in a vocation that the state views as ""useful"" for itself and capital. If you view humans through a supply and demand curve, of course engineers should make more than teachers. But when viewed through a different lens, I would argue that we should be paying teachers more than engineers. Yet, when's the last time we saw a teacher being a super power? Instead of that, we have soldiers, capitalists, etc, making up the lion's share of popular characters. While you could look at Avatar and say it's a critique of neoliberal interventionism, nowhere do I see union leaders being the solution. Most of these films admit the critique, then have someone within the system improve it like a good king. The amount of propaganda in big blockbuster Hollywood American films, even at their most left, is still a far cry from communist propaganda. If Hollywood decided to do a adaptation of The Jungle, I might agree with you, but that would never happen. 

Celebrities live glamorous lives while the working class makes less and less. Hell, go in a leftist circle and ask what people really think of Ellen or celebrity worship in general. We'd mostly be inclined to say that these folks are bougie capitalists that screw over their workers. In addition, the corporate structure of how movies get made is inherently anti socialism. Basically everything nowadays is owned by the mouse or by other humongous film conglomerates to make money at the box office or sell merchandise. It's all about selling stuff to make money for shareholders. How, in any way, can that be considered socialist? 

As it relates to the indie side of politics, of course they're anti-capitalist. That's a tradition going back years, and is largely due to the fact that most artists starve for a bit and tend to view things in more empathetic terms as opposed to hierarchical, or what many here would call realistic, terms. When talking about big Hollywood though, I don't think Roma really is impactful on society as a whole compared to Frozen. 

Critiques of the prominent economic are likely to be seen in any form of large entertainment. Would you expect big block busters to bash communism right now? There's literally none of us walking around, let alone any of us in any sort of prominent position of power. The furthest left we have is Bernie, and he's a social democrat. I haven't seen many unions take over companies, but I have seen corporate powers destroy peoples lives lately. In terms of trying to make a movie relatable from a business perspective, it makes more sense to make a movie that people empathize with. I'm not saying that a movie about the pitfalls of socialism can't be made, but it simply won't make it out of the board room compared to other ideas when it comes to money. 

No commie wants to hear what we would call bougie hypocritical capitalists tell us that climate change is important while they waste fuel flying around the world on private jets. Those folks are more likely to guide people to progressive neoliberal politics, not socialism. But, given that no one seems to understand that the communism liked by actual communists is severely different to the shit peddled by McCarthy, I'm not surprised.",0,,

Massachusetts’ highest court on Tuesday rejected a bid by ExxonMobil to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the state that accuses the oil giant of misleading the public about the role its fossil fuels play in causing climate change.

The lawsuit filed in 2019 by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleges Exxon launched an effort, “reminiscent of the tobacco industry’s long denial campaign about the dangerous effects of cigarettes,” to deceive consumers and investors about climate change.

Massachusetts’ Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling that rejected the company’s argument that a state law shielded it from the lawsuit.

A phone message seeking comment was left with Exxon, which has denied spreading disinformation about the contribution of fossil fuels to global warming.

In a congressional hearing last year, the company's CEO, Darren Woods, told lawmakers that its public statements on climate “are and have always been truthful” and that Exxon has “long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change” and ""devoted significant resources to addressing those risks.″

The Massachusetts lawsuit says Exxon engaged in a “sophisticated, multi-million dollar campaign” to sow doubt in climate science and downplay the link between fossil fuels and climate change. The lawsuit says Exxon also undertook “greenwashing campaigns” in an effort to portray itself as environmentally responsible.

“Rather than honestly disclose and mitigate climate change risks, ExxonMobil’s misrepresentations about and failures to disclose those risks have delayed the needed transition to clean energy around the world and make these existential climate-driven threats to the global economy more likely to occur,” the complaint says.

Healey called the court's ruling a “resounding victory” in the state's efforts to “stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers.”

“Exxon’s repeated attempts to stonewall our lawsuit have been baseless, and this effort was no different. We look forward to proceeding with our case and having our day in court to show how Exxon is breaking the law and to put an end to the deception once and for all,” she said in a statement.

Lawyers for Exxon argued in court documents that the company’s statements about climate change and energy policy were “protected petitioning activity” even if they were made to defend the company’s reputation.

But the top court said the law Exxon claimed should protect the company in this case doesn't apply to government enforcement actions brought by the attorney general.

It's the latest twist in years long battle between Massachusetts and Exxon. The company previously unsuccessfully sued Massachusetts in an effort to block Healey's investigation into Exxon and climate change.",0,,

It isn't that some individual conservatives tend to cherry-pick their facts, but that *anti-intellectualism* is a pillar of the entire conservative platform.  The denial of climate change, the denial of evolution, the insistence that HPV vaccines aren't safe, the belief that welfare queens all drive Cadillacs, the belief that death panels are going to kill grandma, the belief that industries would be safer and more environmentally friendly if only there was no regulation at all, and even the notion that the [teaching of critical thinking](http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/teaching_now/2012/06/texas_gop_no_more_critical_thinking.html) itself is a bad thing - these and dozens of other examples indicate the clear and *systematic* denial of objective facts in favor of comforting fictions.

140,i390q11,,"It does seem that our views are somewhat in alignment, definitely. 

The place we probably mainly diverge is in what we think are the biggest threat and most effective levers, which for me are greenwash/techno-optimism and behavioural change/regulation respectively. The world has lots of people in it who want to do the right thing for the planet and who are willing to make sacrifices to a certain extent and vote for the right policies. Greenwash and false technical solutions neutralise and misappropriate this good will. For example people will pay extra for something to be green, but for almost everything labelled green/eco/sustainable, it’s a lie currently. 

Key disagreements as I understand them are:
- getting off fossil fuels, in my opinion, *isn’t* worth it if the solution is more damaging.
- creating biofuels does not get us off fossil fuels, it merely adds to them. Anti-fossil fuel regulation is the only way to “break the chain”, but as long as the industry can promise that they’ll act without the need for regulation, then they can dupe us into thinking it’s not necessary which brings me to my next point about industry promises
- the industry’s net zero by 2050 forecast for SAFs can be summarised as follows: do almost nothing for 15 years then miraculously ramp up “sustainable” fuel production for just-in-time net zero at 2050. This will mean that by the time we hit 2035 and reach this fabled ramp up, and we finally realise that it is totally unachievable, and worse for the planet, it’ll be too late. In parallel all current company execs will have comfortably retired and shareholders will have already made a tidy sum of money from the preceding 15 years of business as usual. 
- I also disagree with the notion that we can’t expect rapid change. This is one of the fossil fuel industry’s favourite narratives to spread, and it has been working for the last several decades as they’ve dragged their feet as much as possible. People in face to face conversations and in Reddit threads should stop reinforcing this narrative since it is self fulfilling. 

My solutions are as follows: educate people that, contrary to what adverts tells us, new technology and innovations from large companies cannot alone invent us out of a climate catastrophe. This means getting really tough on greenwash and false techno-optimistic solutions which should also help create an appetite for strong regulation. It also means stopping the focus of sustainability being on how much green stuff you do, but instead on how much not green stuff you don’t do. It seems simple, but the narrative almost always centres around, for example, more electric cars, more electric planes, more solar panels, rather than fewer petrol cars, less coal. One more electric car ≠ one less petrol one. Only one less petrol car = one less petrol car. The alternative could be anything or nothing, but the environment only cares about the reduction GHGs. E.g. I could have a fleet of 5 petrol cars. That’s 100% petrol cars. I could then buy 10 EVs (sounds great) and now I’m at 33% petrol cars (also sounds great), but no improvement to combating climate change has been made. So that’s why I call this kind of publicity out as the greenwash it is. In terms of technically what needs doing, we need to curb growth in flying and start flying less, unfortunately. The day flying can be truly green will be 30+ years at least from now. At that point maybe it can have a renaissance. As you can see, it’s not a terribly optimistic view, but at least it might help us avoid the worst of the climate catastrophe. That’s pretty positive.",0,,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/jon-stewart-veterans-burn-pits-gop-cruelty/?utm_source=reddit.com

&gt;Senate Republicans last week provided Americans with a vivid example of their party’s abject cruelty when they rejected the PACT Act, which would provide veterans with benefits to cover the health consequences they endured from exposure to burn pits while serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. They did so even though many of those same Republicans approved a nearly identical bill in June.

&gt;For a tutorial on how to respond to the lies and heartlessness Republicans have shown here, Democrats should turn to an unlikely source: comedian Jon Stewart.

&gt;The GOP’s reversal on the bill seems to be motivated by payback. Republicans voted against the PACT Act because they were angry over the agreement between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the Inflation Reduction Act, the reconciliation package that includes tax hikes on the wealthy, subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage and investment in green energy. The deal was announced just hours after the Senate passed its bipartisan bill to enhance national security and U.S. competitiveness against China by investing in semiconductor manufacturing.

&gt;Jon Stewart joined Democratic lawmakers in the District on July 28 after Senate Republicans blocked a new plan to help millions of veterans. (Video: The Washington Post)
In other words, Republicans threw a temper tantrum because they would no longer be able to hold the semiconductor bill hostage to block passage of the Democrats’ popular agenda. Think about that for a second. Republicans took their frustrations with Democrats out on sick veterans. That’ll show them!

&gt;In the days since the GOP stalled the bill, Stewart was unflinching. He went in front of cameras on Thursday to express what many Americans were feeling. Regarding Republicans’ about-face on the bill, Stewart said he was used to the “hypocrisy,"" “lies” and “cowardice” of politicians, but “I am not used to the cruelty.”

&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) offered a patently false excuse that the bill would create “pork.” In fact, the funds are delineated for a specific purpose. As Stewart tweeted: “The PACT Act is a stand alone bill. The PACT Act has no spending unrelated to Veteran’s Health and Benefits. There is no ‘Pork.’ There is no budget maneuver that then allows Dems to backfill [with] whatever they want.”

&gt;Stewart, appearing on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, kept up the barrage:

 
&gt;Republicans will likely come crawling back to approve the bill now that they have been exposed as deceitful, malicious and petulant. But Democrats should learn from Stewart and apply his techniques in other contexts.


&gt;In the abortion realm, Democrats should be clear. It is the height of dishonesty to say that abortion bans, which would endanger women’s health and lives, are “pro-life.” And it is simply untrue that these bills are about preventing abortions moments before delivery, as so many Republicans claim. The Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban third-trimester abortions. All but a handful already did before the Dobbs decision. One percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks and far fewer in the third trimester. It is a lie to say abortion causes women emotional distress or physical injury or that abortion is dangerous.

&gt;And it is cruel and barbaric to demand that a teen rape victim endure pregnancy and labor or to demand a woman with chronic health conditions risk pregnancy. Only monsters would insist that doctors wait until women are so sick that they might die before they can receive appropriate medical treatment, which includes abortions.

&gt;Stewart is a gifted communicator. His basic approach — righteous anger, blunt language, mastery of the facts, determination to call out the GOP’s bad faith — is something all Democrats should follow, whether the topic is veterans’ health, abortion, the Jan. 6 insurrection, guns, climate change or just about anything else. Enough is enough.

&gt;  
&gt;The Emmy award winner said he was inspired to support a new documentary The Atlantic after witnessing the bullying and slow death of coastal communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;The feature-length film - from the maker of The Pipe, which explored Shell's Corrib Gas project in Co Mayo - examines the exploitation of finite resources off Irish shores, and Newfoundland and Norway.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it gets unprecedented whistle-blower access to the workings of a super-trawler - a mammoth factory ship which drags nets the size of football pitches to scoop up tonnes of fish at a time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said: "" I feel that we haven't valued either the resources or the communities that can live from them.  
&gt;  
&gt;""What I meant by self-respect was in our own terms of self-respect, as a nation in looking after the communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are hammering the small man and we are legitimising these massive factory ships.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson was encouraged to take part in the documentary after spending time in Newfoundland filming the Grand Seduction where he saw ageing, seaside communities with little future, as cod quotas remain closed.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These communities are dying on their feet. The moratorium has destroyed the whole culture and way of life,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's just patently appalling and patently wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;""But I was really inspired to what they did in response. They showed a sense of self respect that we have not really done here.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Documentary film-maker Richie O Domhnaill, a theoretical physics graduate and TV cameraman, travelled to Arranmore, where he spent time with local fisherman Jerry Early.  
&gt;  
&gt;The nets man was prosecuted for catching salmon at sea while for several months of the year he watches gigantic trawlers pull vast quantities of white fish from the depths a few miles offshore.  
&gt;  
&gt;""They are not being policed,"" Gleeson said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's one rule for the big boys and one rule for the small boys.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Under a European trade-off for increased farming benefits Ireland gifts about a billion euro worth of fish from its seas every year to other EU countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said protecting the sea's resources has to take precedence over ""some dodgy stuff that was done in the 80s"" referring to Ireland's tax write -offs for oil and gas exploration at sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the film O Domhnaill also visited the tiny Canadian village of Renews and spent time in Norway with Bjornar Nicolaisen who offered a careful and philosophical outlook on the use of the Atlantic's resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said his experience of coastal communities was that they were dying out as big business capitalises on the seas.

Yes, 99% of the people I've met in my life are politically left wing and the ones that aren't are usually way older than me or not in a position where I can shoot the shit with them, but among people I know, I'm the only one who actively goes out and looks for the conservative opinion. 


I also know a lot of insanely stupid left leaning folk, too. 


&gt; I'm sorry I'm being so dismissive, but I ""honestly can't fathom"" how anyone can be so narrow minded that they end up as befuddled as you profess to be about the thinking of people on the other side of the debate while simultaneously exhibiting such ignorance about who those people actually are.


I hear way more hardcore Bible thumping, evolution/climate change/moon landing denying, homophobic, racist, intolerant, selfish, Glenn Beck parroting, Tea Party-ish rhetoric from the right than anything else. Twenty times more. Seriously. If a liberal doesn't actively go searching for conservative opinions like I'm doing right now, that's all you hear coming from the right (and it is partly the left's fault as the extreme right is what gets fixated on in liberal media). That's a large part of the reason people on the left have their heads up their own asses. It feels like the other side is hiding in caves in Montana with ham radios, trying to convince the rest of the world that the second coming of Christ is upon us. 


When I lived in Japan the only English station on the radio was AFN. Every evening when I was driving home from work, Rush Limbaugh would be on air for about an hour and I would listen to the whole thing. It made my blood boil without fail. I've been feeling a huge amount of cognitive dissonance over it as on the one hand, the only conservative opinion I ever hear sounds like absolute lunacy to me. On the other hand, I know that these people are intelligent, three dimensional people like anyone else, I've just never had an opportunity to actually level with them and all I hear from their side comes out of the mouth of people like Sarah Palin. It's actually hard to find level headed conservatives who aren't fixated on the social dimension. Hence me coming here. 


&gt; Don't get me wrong, this isn't about liberal or conservative. I've run into way too many conservatives who are just as myopic and willfully ignorant about the arguments (and the merits to those arguments) made by the other side and it bugs the hell out of me.


I think part of the problem is that both sides only hear one narrative that represents the other side. On the left, we only hear Tea Party-esque rhetoric coming from the right. On the right, the left probably looks like a bunch of beret wearing vegan hipsters or something. 


It doesn't help that the west, specifically the US, is more politically divided than any other point in centuries.

190,f1da4cp,,"&gt; It's not about climate change, it's about bullying some Plebs so you can feel better about yourself.

It’s not about bullying anyone, it’s about pointing out hypocrisy and standing up for the literal billions of animals that die yearly, and the future billions of animals that will die in the mass extinction event we are hurtling towards. Vegan activism has never been about bullying people (and of you think that’s what that sign is doing then good lord) but it’s been about compassion for our fellow animals. 

But it is about climate change. Carbon emissions, methane pollution, groundwater pollution, water pollution from the contaminated groundwater and the surface runoff of pollutants, etc. These are all impacted by the animal agriculture industry. 

&gt; Not eating meat is a significant downgrade in standart of living 

My sense of morality, bank account, and general health all disagree here but okay. Vegan diets are cheaper, healthier, and don’t hurt anyone at all (except the animal agriculture industry) 

&gt; Sure, almost 20% of all Co2 emissions being the meat industry is bad. Ever wondered about the other 80%?

That 20% doesn’t even include the pollution from transportation linked to it. If that were included you’d probably be closer to 35%. 
And I do wonder about the rest of the pollution. How can we reduce that at the same time in order to save our planet and the life it holds on it? Can we try the billionaires running the corporations responsible for climate change for crimes related to the willing destruction of the environment? What can I do in my daily life to try and help fight climate change?",0,,

Only being able to absorb enough to live from a high fat diet. It may as well be magic. If you think I am alone in this you might want to read up on the number of people on the planet who would literally die without meat.

You might want to also look up the explosion in the rate of diabetes among the populations of countries where grains make up the majority of their daily caloric intake. Human beings aren't meant to survive on on a diet consisting primarily of complex carbs. Yes it's possible to do so but it causes serious health problems in the long run.

As I said, yes the planet needs to reduce its meat consumption but that isn't far off from the current consumption levels overall. The majority of meat consumed is concentrated in certain countries but if those were reduced and everyone was to eat balanced diets. Instead of surviving on rice and beans the overall consumption levels would not change much. Dramatically reducing the consumption of meat to transition people to plant based diets is going to result in trading human lives for animal lives. 

No, growing up on a farm isn't how I obtained an education regarding nutrition, biology, or ethics. I depend on the courses I took while pursuing a degree pharmaceutical engineering with a focus in psychopharmacology when drawing my conclusions of the nutritional requirements of a human as opposed to a cow. We even had fancy courses specifically on biomedical ethics.

Personally I think that shooting a couple of animals a year which would otherwise have created an excessive demand on the local ecosystem. Resulting in the death of multiple animals. While harvesting my own naturally grown vegetables. Meaning I directly contribute 2-3 animal deaths per year in order to feed my family. Causes less animal harm than someone who purchases all of their vegan groceries at the supermarket. Vegan products that contribute to animal deaths at factory farms. The human suffering borne of human trafficking and slave labor. Along with the environmental impacts resulting from the processing and transport of those vegan foods.

Thats a tough call. 

The vegan who contributes to the factory farm system that kills millions of animals a year and is accelerating climate change. In order to obtain specific vegan products, rather than obtaining a balanced diet from the local community. 

Versus the hunter who kills 2-3 animals a year under the supervision of the department of environmental conservation. Paying for tags which provide funding for the departments conservation efforts. Which helps keep the entire animal population healthy. While taking on the direct personal responsibility of minimizing any animal suffering that is needed in order for them to be able to eat.

Yeah, we’re the peasants being told all of this drivel while these elitist climate dictators continue to live their life of luxury. But hey, change your life all in the name of climate change.  Can someone say “do as I say, not as I do” much?

Yeah peaches, I don’t take you seriously. Get the hell out of the way, you selfish phony you.",1,A. Personal moral hypocrisy,
210,do99fxi,,"I'm going to disagree that we have consented and are consenting to the madness that created him since none of us have any decision-making powers on the situation. It's like saying that we are consenting to everything that Duterte is doing by remaining within the confines of the Philippine territory, and that if we don't, ede umalis tayo ng Pilipinas. Any form of expression of frustration or sympathy towards Xander Ford, in fact, seems like an expression of the exact opposite.

And while I agree that talking about it feeds the hype machine, so what? Is the effect negative or positive? Does it amplify the bullying instead of negating it? Should we as a society stop talking about sex ed then, because it seems to be feeding into people's sex drives and encouraging to contract more STDs; or about sexual harassment, because it seems to be feeding into women's courage to call out openly sexist men and their personal experiences of harassment in the workplace? I really don't understand why you are pushing *so hard* for common people dismiss him and not to care in favor of other pressing social issues when, in reality, *anyone* who stands up for anyone being bullied will do and can only yield tremendous positive effects for the society at large. Do you really think that he would go as far as getting a surgery if his family, his friends, and other people in his life genuinely cared like you are propositioning, or that they even know how to handle the situation? Just looking at what's been demonstrated, it's far more likely that they don't. What is wrong about feeding a hype when you're doing something good?

And finally, no, our society isn't fucked up if we only talk about what's trending. *That has always been how democratic human societies have worked.* In fact, the best way to get something done about a problem has always been to hype it up, feed the hype, and let the hype blow up. Only then will legislators be pressured to put policies in place to directly address the problem. You're being massively idealistic (and in effect, yes, you are ranking their importance) by fighting so hard to shut down all discussion on bullying and colonial mentality in our notions of beauty to instead talk about climate change, poverty, EJKs, corruption--when, because Xander Ford's case is trending, you have an opportunity now and the people's backing to address the undesirable of cyberbullying/colonial mentality, which is equally undesirable as other social issues. You just can't make people care about other issues if they're not trending now, and when something is trending, it is an *opportunity* to do something about it, not a sign that the society is fucked. Only so many things can trend at a time. That's just how the world works.

Thanks for apologizing and I appreciate the consideration, but know that I'm not taking any offense--you haven't hurled any ad hominems anyway. I think we do agree in principle and maybe in our bottomline politics, but I just don't like manifestations of those principles that contradict each other. Our own contradictions are why right-wingers or Dutertards are being swung to the opinions that they currently hold because our contradictions are an excuse for them to call us hypocrites.",0,,
