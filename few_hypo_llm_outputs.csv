1,"If you care about climate change and have done your research then yes I think it’s hypocritical not to be vegan as it is the most effective (and w/least amount of effort) way that we as consumers can help and create positive changes.

The thing is, vegan activists are not physically causing suffering to anyone nor being violent towards anyone with direct action. The people who own animal ag/fur or any business where animals are used for them to get profit are actually directly causing pain, suffering and death to other living beings, so that’s the difference.",1,1,1,1,"The commenter explicitly states that it is hypocritical to care about climate change and not be vegan, indicating a perceived inconsistency between professed beliefs (caring about climate change) and personal behavior (not being vegan).

Smh. 
I’ve seen the mines, I live close to  them, and it absolutely blows my mind how they are destroying nature, displacing people and demolishing villages just for the dirty and energy dilute lignite, to then spread the pollution across germany and the netherlands.

5,"The price for nuclear energy is a show stopper. People still arguing for nuclear energy in Europe are so behind the curve. And that is just completely ignoring the political mine field of building these complex, constantly over-budget, state-subsidized monstrosities. And calling it the cleanest is just bizarre. We need just one of these plants to be the target of a succesful terror attack, in a war zone, be badly managed because of budget cuts or corruption to change all this. This is also why these plants are uninsurable because no company can underwrite the value of an entire city.

11,"Well it would be hypocritical of me if, having found the vitriol on other subs too toxic, I turned this sub into some kind of ongoing embittered rant at the lack of engagement. Certainly, I won't be giving up on the Migrator sub (just avoiding other reddit subs), but I've said what needed to be said and shall be moving on. Stellar lifting -my word, how that model could be considered remotely more feasible than asteroid mining is beyond me. Apparently to propose asteroid mining fits the data is 'crackpot' and 'away with the fairies', but having vast platforms 'coaxing' coronal mass from the star's blistering heliosphere, then streaming it like a 'sprinkler' millions of miles to a habitable zone (not that you'd need one if capable of such technology) is 'just engineering' ! Though I've had no input from the astrophysics community, I have from engineers with whom I've consulted on the physics of the asteroid milling platforms. It's time to move on, I need to focus on getting my second book out and some kind of abstract the astrophysics community can engage with. This just means I'll be making less posts here, but please keep visiting because the model has immense implications if the signifiers I propose gain weight as being credible. Because they are associated directly with the activity (asteroid mining), this is what I propose the (proposed) ETI signal says...

*""Look, we're flagging up the symmetry of our harvesting operation through mathematical affirmation routes. Why would we do that rather than send telecommunications? Obviously a telecommunication warning specific to asteroid mining would have to be detected and deciphered (which could take centuries, assuming the vast signal was downloaded without blips) -there must be urgency implied by our signal. There is: a single asteroid can impact a mother world with the force of one billion megatons leading to species extinction, we've seen it (or barely survived it ourselves) before. To avoid sowing gravitational entropy in the wider asteroid belt, follow our example of a clean systematic sectorial operation. This is our* ***siren warning*** *to the galaxy.""*

This song, which I use as a kind of ambassador for the proposed ETI signal, says it all with a few playful change of words - *'...what a warning - you will weep for the rocks and mountains, when the asteroids begin to fall.' †*

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmHwtodPuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmHwtodPuI)

† Note the warning is not one regarding ***a lack of intelligence*** when it comes to asteroid mining, any species capable of reaching the belt and harvesting the rocks will know there could be potentially apocalyptic consequences if bungled, the warning regards a ***biological flaw*** in any species comprised of members with relatively limited life spans to prioritise immediate profit regardless of the long term impact.

15,"&gt;It's a very stupid argument.

No, it's the natural response to hypocrisy. 

And it's never that the woke person 'contributes' to climate change, it's that they contribute immensely to climate change, far more than the average person they are trying to guilt into changing their lifestyles.

I live in Australia. While there isn't a fire close to me (the nearest one was 20km away, and burnt for a week early December), I haven't seen blue skies since October.

I have lost one friend to these fires last week (heart attack while helping one of his mates fight a fire on his property at the other end of the state); another friend lost his rural 'retirement' property to one of the earlier fires back in November, and I've spent the last 6 weeks or so looking after his house, garden and pets while he's been up north clearing the rubble from his burnt-out place.

In my lifetime in Australia, I have - until this summer - only experienced a handful of days above the 100'F/37'C level. I have had more days this summer over that mark than I have had in the 47 years previous. What is absurd though is the number of days in the high 40s - something I'd never experience before now, but we've had 4 or 5 just this summer.

Australia, despite its recent history of changing Prime Ministers quite rapidly, recently changed the rules for deposing a PM, and its just as well they did, because the vitriol the current incumbent attracts is unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime - and I am a political historian by training. He's a climate change denialist, and has displayed a level of incompetence, denial, lack of empathy and cluelessness probably not seen in a head of government since Ceausescu. The hatred for him and his ruling clique is so strong I rate it about a 30% chance that we will see the emergence of a violent eco-terrorist movement in Australia inside three years.

Prior to this season, I have always been a bit on-the-quiet about my ""insurance preparations"". My best friend knows, and my son knows. But noone else. Not for any security reason, but I kept it under my hat because it seemed a bit tin-foily and crack-pot. Now, it's a regular topic of conversation.

Much of the data claiming to ""prove"" AGW has been manipulated and/or discredited, models can't be duplicated, spotty or no peer reviews were conducted, samples too small to be conclusive were used, and many scientists are jumping the AGW ship. Even the IPPC has admitted it has cherry-picked data to get the results it wanted to showcase. Former Greenpeace leader Gerd Leipold has been videotaped in interviews admitting to global warming exaggerations lies, such as with the bogus polar bear reports and Arctic ice melting. Liberal media ignores record low temps and hysterically reports any record high temps to support the bogus science of AGW.

How dare they suggest I give up a fraction of what's mine it to someone less deserving than me, and god help anyone who tries to actually do it through policy reform/ tax rate adjustments/ carbon taxes etc. But I don't care about other taxes that don't negatively affect me directly, and hurt the most vulnerable (least deserving by natural order because something something lobsters). Now as an informed and obviously intelligent citizen (having read 12 rules for life qualifies me to that self appraisal, and 'understanding' Maps of meaning means I'm a freaking genius, plus I've got a pocket full of $5 words to spend if any doubts me or makes me doubt myself, but like many people with a little wealth, they don't quite know how to spend in a way that is concidered genuine to those with a little more wealth.

Of course it's not 'that simple' and I'm not suggesting everyone who reads the TL;DR on wiki, or buys his book, or donates to Patreon are all the same and behave the same. But I will say this, any one who thinks they're immune to the effects of propaganda are literally delusional and have a fuck load of hard and possibly painful work to do, and they certainly should not be relying on one (or a few) sources of information to do this.

&gt; A real education is a good foundation, which Peterson also devalues unless it's STEM with high income potential in an increasingly competitive and over-populated field, though He does value the trades (but who doesn't, besides a few boomers who wanted better for their children), so I'll give him credit there (but tradies aren't formally  trained to think critically enough to see through and oppose him, so of course he likes them).

Lie 1a. You can't just claim they don't have the money when they already twice (linked) demonstrated they DID have the money by sending the people to other camps with better services. The new and for-profits camps are paid $750-775 per child per night, there is no rational application of math that takes you from being paid $750 per night per kid to not affording soap, blankets, combs, toothpaste, and food. No, it's intentional.

&gt; Perhaps the democrats really do have a problem accepting facts. 

&gt; So you believe congress just passed an unnecessary billion dollar emergency funding bill for fun? You seem smarter than that. 

See: the two links that you ignored, it shows the opposite in both cases. Dems voted for bills in both houses allowing more aid because they can't directly control conditions. The Dem bill required conditions improved for the children with funds to help it pass. GOP bill gave no standards for care improvement and even had a rider for funds for Pentagon. I'd love to see how you spin that.

&gt; They wouldn't be there if congress hadn't passed the laws that Trump is enforcing. They wouldn't be there if there were less lawbreakers trying to game the system. There are a lot of scenarios. I don't accuse you of lying because you don't list them all.

Well thanks for not accusing me of lies whilst lying. When I said pre-Trump, I said it because of Trump. I meant what I said. Trump in April 2018 changed civil charges to criminal and detained asylum seekers. That wasn't through Congress. Trump changed protocol to allow detention of those who would not have been detained, and in doing so he created a legal violation through Flores. Congress got involved until Trump promised to not detain over the 20day deadline, but Trump's still doing it. Trump by rule is not ""enforcing"" the law, he changed DoJ policy and ended up VIOLATING the law.

&gt; if conjunction

It is what he said, it's what he's been saying, it's even what his team has been saying. Just a tip, this is a poor time to double down on the ""if"" as if Trump hasn't been calling conditions good if not perfect, given the Pence video from last night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B29-zYvMdAE&amp;feature=youtu.be Enjoy Pence saying to the press that ""each and every one of the children... and parents that I spoke to told me they were being treated well"" just after coming out of camps of 400 people packed with little space and lots of stench, and his own OIG report listing conditions failures.

&gt; I'm just saying that California soccer mom who drives a prius and votes democrat also has strange views on vaccines. I'm sure you could Google Hollywood antivax for yourself. 

I did. The very first link was talking about the public partisan backlash against anti-vacc celebs. ""...In recent years, however, vaccine policy has taken on a partisan bent, with Republicans tending to favor looser immunization mandates, according to Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings School of Law in San Francisco who studies vaccine laws...In California, lawmakers have proposed tightening rules to make it more difficult for parents to obtain medical exemptions that allow them to keep their children unvaccinated...State Senator Richard Pan, the Sacramento-area Democrat who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, is a pediatrician with a master’s degree in public health. He lamented Ms. Biel’s foray into the political debate."" Oops? Want to try another?

&gt;[Hypocrisy...is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy)

End of discussion.

&gt;If a man has a certain reaction to a woman's behavior and other men share that sentiment then together they share that perspective.

Yes, they do. Many people share the perspective that black people are inferior beings, etc. That doesn't make them correct if they cannot back up their views in any valid way. You could state that a woman who was a virgin was a slut and then if men agreed on it then you would argue that it then has validity. It doesn't have validity.

&gt;I feel like our perspectives on dating and sleeping around in the 'contemporary climate' is different. I have female friends that go on a lot of dates, but don't sleep around. They take their dating lives seriously and often end up in LTRs. I also have female friends that are technically not slutting it up because they are having sex within the context of a 'relationship'. However, because they have a string of these short relationships it damages their reputation. I know a girl that every time I see her every few weeks she has a new boyfriend. It reached a point where I don't bother learning the names of these guys because the trend shows that they won't last. Her behavior has damaged her reputation in our social circle, and guys that know her as friends are less willing to take her seriously from what I hear.

Go to the top rated comment [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/5mz753/cmv_slut_shaming_is_primarily_a_f2f_issue/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=PurplePillDebate). Notice that the only RPer that responded to that was a woman because most RPers are too immature to take responsibility for their actions when they have real world consequences. They'd rather continue with their bullshit internet circle jerk.

&gt;The reason women are punished for this situation is because they are the ones that get hurt in these situations.

This is a ridiculous argument coming from anyone. But when it comes from RPers, who also advocate men sleeping around and avoiding commitment, while also claiming that they're somehow saving society by slut shaming, then it becomes literally absurd.

What you are effectively saying is that men should be rewarded for misleading women and women should be punished for being misled. And then RPers wonder why they're considered misogynists!

&gt;The argument that it's not an achievement is not used to refute the position that it is an achievement for women. It is used to support the argument that n-count/casual sex impacts women's and men's reputation differently.

Yes, but it's a bad argument because women extremely rarely set out with the intention of notching their bedpost in the first place. Women do not think it is an achievement to sleep around and they don't value it. So it therefore makes no sense to make this argument. It is spurious.

&gt;Because that is a personal standard, that is shaped by personal tastes and experience.

If you cannot reasonably agree on or even define something then the whole concept of referring to it as unhealthy is invalidated. Why is this unhealthy? Because I say that it is. What evidence do you have that it's unhealthy? None! Brilliant argument!

&gt;This dynamic is a little polarized, but in my experience it is pretty accurate. I hope my perspective will make sense to you when I contextualize it. The kind of advances people are talking about when it comes to plate-spinning and abundance mentality are low effort. Women that come to nightclubs and hook up with a guy who has attempted the same approach with 20 other girls in the same nightclub, does not create a valuable interaction for herself. In the eyes of a man that really like her this girl's value is downgraded from 'I should take her out to a nice dinner and that stuck-up bar that I don't really like but girls love it when you take them there' to 'I just have to say whatever that guy she's never met before said in a nightclub'. On the contrary high-value women will not accept this low effort approach, and for me that was a very frustrating lesson to learn. That when you reach a certain level being a player can actually be a detriment to getting into a relationship with a woman you really respect and desire. It doesn't mean she is only into chads, but she is not down to be with a guy who hits on everything that moves.

Slut shaming is a socially fabricated concept. Sex has no value other than what you afford it. Sex is arguably the most normal of all human behaviours, its why you're here and childbirth occurs in the first place. One might reasonably wonder why a demonised, filthy, taboo act leads to life itself. 

Yet, naturally enough, everyone wants to have sex. So you are invalidating something which is perfectly natural and merely following irrational dogma which has existed since human beings had all sorts of absurd beliefs that we would now view as laughable.

Sex is the number one underlying factor for human interaction, and absolutely the number one underlying component of dating. To ascribe people with a low valuation because they have sex is merely a superstition and in the cold light of day is completely lacking in logic.

&gt;I don't think it's shaming for sharing your personal preferences, that is taking it a little too far.

I have said over and over again that people's preferences are their own preferences and no-one can change that. I never made any statement about people's preferences. This has nothing to do with slut shaming, which is...

[A form of social stigma applied to people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate traditional expectations for sexual behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming).

Possessing and Buy are two different things. The US has a large hunting culture. Not going to change nor do American want to stop fathers and sons from hunting together and promoting a positive gun culture.

Its unconstitutional how it was banned it will be overturned, Presidents don't have the power nor should to make laws 

Edit: power

Stating facts 
https://reason.com/blog/2018/12/20/new-jerseys-gun-owners-do-not-seem-eager

Its settled until the Supreme Court gets involved. Which most likely they will not, meaning that Magazine size limits are unconstitutional 

&gt; You can own a .50 cal gun

So? Never heard of someone using it to commit a crime. Based on your logic 9mm should be banned first as they kill more than another other round. I don't see that happening: see the above about Americans not wanting Handguns bans

&gt; Irrelevant to fact its easy to do

Completely relevant, because no one has ever used a AR15 illegal modified to commit a crime. I can make almost any semi-automatic gun automatic with the right tool and know-how.

&gt; They did, republicans wanted to place sand bags in satellites taking pictures of the effects of climate change, entirely a dem effort thats succeeded despite republicans.

Ok, don't disagree

76,"&gt; And that makes my statement untrue how? Like I said, most people know only one side of the story

Knowing only one side of the story is not the issue. Even people who know about the other side of the story stick to beliefs that are in line with their political perspective. In fact, among Republicans, the ones who are most informed about scientific issues, the ones who read stuff about science and show high scientific literacy on non-climate questions, are no less skeptical about anthropogenic climate change being a serious concern than their less-informed brethren. You would expect that educated and scientifically literate Republicans would be more likely to have encountered arguments and evidence for climate change, so if climate change denial is due to lack of information, you would expect they would be less skeptical. But this is not what we see. 

Polarization on the issue is not primarily due to lack of information or one-sided information. It is due to the fact that beliefs have become signals of political identity, and people who are deeply attached to a particular political identity conform their beliefs to fit that identity, even if they are fully aware of the arguments on the other side.

If you want to research this yourself, search for the ""knowledge deficit model"" or ""information deficit model"" on Google Scholar. That is essentially the model you are advocating -- that climate denialism is primarily a consequence of lacking relevant information. You will find that the vast majority of contemporary scholarship on the issue rejects this model when it comes to views about climate change. So, ironically, in advocating the information deficit model you yourself are going against the scientific consensus. [Here](http://blog.nature.org/science/2013/03/01/dan-kahan-climate-changescience-communications/) is an article to get you started.

&gt; Clearly, climate change is associated with the left wing media so the more right wing person is, the more likely they are to dismiss it as liberal propaganda or some such. 

Right, but you initially said that the problem is ""Nobody really even tried to explain to them how it works and how we can know it is true."" The thing is, a lot of articles *do* explain this, but, as you said, they are dismissed by conservatives as liberal propaganda. And this is not just about news articles. Climate scientists get dismissed as liberal propagandists too. Because the issue is so politicized, it's not a simple matter of explaining how it works, because anyone who tries to do that will get identified as a political operative.

&gt; News outlets are more of a marketplace of bullshit narratives...

The whole point of the ""marketplace of ideas"" concept is that if everyone has the freedom to disseminate their own arguments and ideas, then competition between these ideas will lead to the best ideas becoming commonly accepted while the worst ones get rejected.

But if you believe that news outlets are a marketplace of bullshit narratives, then you are implicitly conceding that this idealistic ""marketplace of ideas"" concept doesn't work. If the mainstream media has realized that what sells is not good ideas and honest information but sensationalized bullshit, then *that is what the marketplace produces and supports*.

&gt; anyways what is your better alternative to marketplace of ideas?

I don't have a fully worked out alternative, but you don't need to have an alternative to point out the flaws in a pre-existing concept.
Here's a vague recommendation, though: 

Certain kinds of policy decisions are crucially dependent on scientific knowledge. Climate policy is a good example. I think decisions of that sort should be more insulated from the vagaries of democratic politics, and more in the hands of properly credentialed experts than elected politicians. Perhaps when it comes to science-related policy-making, elected officials should only be able to vote on ""if... then..."" policies, that say things like ""If the science says X, then do this; if it says Y, then do this; etc."" Once that bill is passed, experts get to decide which of the ""if"" clauses is accurate and enact the corresponding policy. This means politicians don't make judgments about what the science says, only about how we should respond if the science says a particular thing. A politician who is currently a global warming skeptic may still agree that *if* anthropogenic global warming is a serious issue, *then* we should curb carbon emissions. It would be up to experts to decide whether or not global warming is actually a serious issue.",0,0,0,0,"The comment is a detailed discussion about the polarization of beliefs regarding climate change and the role of political identity in shaping those beliefs.

They are using dark PR firms 'Cambridge Analytics psyops' campaigns using facebook microtargeting and groups - what the hell for? there's no election so why is this a legit course of action during a crisis?

It is absolutely disgusting is that the Liberal Party has been waging psychological warfare with a toxic disinformation campaign online as a 'government response' to the climate change bush fire disaster. [I've posted this again as it needs to be known]

The past few weeks have seen a tsunami of hateful and bigoted posts from mostly bot accounts paid for and run by the Liberal Party as a response to the heat they are feeling over the climate change bush fire disaster.

If you're wondering where all these invective deflections and diversions are coming from it is a open secret that the Liberal Party is using the PR/information warfare firm Topham Guerin to wage a disinformation campaign online to take the heat off their unpopularity and culpability in this disaster (two decades of shutting down any program that would have helped in the fire disaster such as closing the climate change commission, funding for Rural Fire Service, funding for national parks to manage fuel loads, rejecting experts demanding aerial firefighting equipment, the list is endless)

**Let me make this clear, in the midst of the death and carnage and anger from the electorate on so many incompetent acts that they are more concerned with their popularity than with responsible governance.**

**How is it appropriate that as this disaster unfolds the LNP decided to respond with psychological warfare to anger and deceive the Australian community with this toxic disinformation campaign?**

During a climate change disaster, this climate change denying Govt has embarked on a disinformation campaign on facebook etc coupled with some assistance from the Murdoch press spreading this disinformation.

I am flabbergasted this not front page news that should end the Government.

Australians are just starting to realise that there has been odd behavior on their social media platforms in the last couple weeks and its attributed to an intensive election style Cambridge Analytica rote psychological warfare and this has been widely documented. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/08/australia-where-lies-and-conspiracy-theories-spread-like-bushfire

&gt;A Liberal Party spokesperson declined to say if the party was still using TG's services but noted Topham Guerin ""did an outstanding job for the party during the recent election campaign"".

How's that for a non-answer that confirms our suspicions. FYI Topham Guerin have a track record of assisting state and federal Liberal Party campaigns, they are the goto guys for their campaigning and no doubt are directly or through an intermediary they are behind this.

They engaged an information warfare firm about two weeks ago to blame the greens, fuel loads, to misappropriate indigenous culture with the newly coined 'cultural burning' and by deflecting and diverting attention away from climate change they hoped it would muddy the waters.

They even describe the methods

Act fast Break things, move on - like the Russian information warfare, lies, conspiracies, a firehose of mistruth and no time for people to research, and designed to enrage people so they forget about their beef with the incompetant govt

Water dripping on a stone - a repeated message. On the hour every hour we are getting debunked conspiracies in the form of memes sent by fake fb profiles almost always blurry screenshots from conspiracy sites, then useful idiots who believe the lies and spread the invective material (eg greens are responsible for the fires because they oppose hazard reduction burns which is a total lie and even refuted by the RFS)

Arousal Emotions - full on psychological warfare by the Liberal Party on people to get them mad enough to forget about their growing unease with our hypocritical govt

Pumping out Boomer Memes - ""Guerin said the team adopted the 80/20 rule, meaning that if something was 80 per cent good enough, it would just be published, even if it had a small typo or was missing a full stop."" Poor editing also makes it look more genuinely from their bigoted supporters

It might well be that nuclear is not the large part of the solution to climate change as it is now, and perhaps just because new nuclear plants are prohibitively expensive to build, but that simply doesn't in any way whatsoever justify ruling nuclear as unsustainable. Consider that when you make a policy decision like this you aren't just deciding about options as they are now, you are also considering them for an extremely wide range of possible other political and technological developments. You have to take all possible scenarios into account when making policy. Again this decisions simply isn't about whether nuclear is a solution to climate change.

90,"Allow me to offer an analogy,

I'm also an environmentalist. To me, I see the actions taken by the fossil fuel industry to reduce the action on climate change as being complicit with genocide. I am fully aware of how terrible climate change will be and that there are people who are also aware but chose profit over the future of humanity. I still have to get to work.

96,"Consider what you're actually proposing though. Lets say that he did free all his slaves, and instead paid them wages.    
Realistically, how does that work? Any products his farm produced would be vastly more expensive than anyone else's. He'd give up his slaves, lose his wealth and influence, and end up a morally upstanding person who was no longer of consequence. The dude died in *massive* debt, so if he gave up his slaves and all his property, he'd have been destitute and likely wind up debtor's prison, basically a slave himself.    
  
I agree it'd have been great for his slaves. It very likely would have made no difference on the grand scale except to take away Jefferson's platform.   
    
It strikes me as kind of ignorant, at best, to not consider the facts here. You condemn Jefferson as being a hypocrite for being against slavery yet not freeing his slaves.    
How about *you* though? You use computers, smart phones, and other products which are almost certainly made with some form of forced labor. You eat foods picked by underpaid migrant workers or outright slaves. You very likely ride or drive in personal vehicles and eat meat, despite knowing that those things contribute to climate changes.     
Do you want to solve homelessness? Why not give all your money to homeless shelters and go live in one yourself?    
Why don't you give up all your possessions and comforts, and live the most simple life you can in service to others?     
  
Would those personal actions actually help anything though, or would you just be one weirdo who basically can't function in your community because of your moral absolutism?   
    
This is the kind of bullshit argument that people use to prevent progress. Claim someone is a hypocrite, and use that to discredit the validity of the changes they want.    
It's a fucking catch 22. If you're a ""have"" and advocate for change, then you're a hypocrite; if you're a ""have not"" and advocate for change, then you're just a bitter nobody, so why should anyone listen?   
No one is allowed to advocate for change except some impossibly pure saint.   
  
     
You, me, and nearly everyone are no more than one step removed from contributing to the evils of our own time. You're not morally indemnified just because you aren't *personally* enslaving the West African children who harvest the cacao of the chocolate you eat.   
The fact is that we are all held hostage to the social and economic realty of the day. No matter what, even as you try to change things, you may have to engage in the same evils you decry.   
  
There's a reason why people advocate for *government* solutions. When it's a matter of the law, it puts everyone on even ground. It means that *no one* is benefiting from slave labor. It means that *every* business you compete with has to pay the minimum wage. It means that *everyone* has to pay X amount of taxes.   
   
Was Jefferson a financial idiot and spoiled elitist? Unarguably.    
Is it really reasonable to ask a person to give up everything they have and send themselves into destitution based on moral grounds? Not really. If you think it is, *you do it first*.

98,"&gt;There is no feasible way to 'ethics check' everything that you buy. On top of global supply chains being massive and always including varying degrees of unethical practices, much of it goes unreported.

I buy, like, two pairs of shoes a year. If I cared about labour standards, I could easily check. Same goes for any other article of clothing-- I couldn't check every single individual item, but I could easily avoid the worst brands at minimal impact to my pocket bock.

All you're doing is making an argument in favor of laziness.

&gt;Now personally, I'll accept that consumption is generally unethical. I'm indirectly supporting sweatshops, climate change, slavery and even cartels. However, I exist in a world where I either need to consume or die. The choice is a false one, so I'd not consider it a personal failure on anyone's part if they consume.

That's a false dichotomy. There is plenty of middle ground between naked consumerism and death. I don't expect people to be perfect, because I most certainly am not. But to say you support X and then not actually act in favor of X is hypocrisy. I'm in favor of reducing overall suffering. To that end, I've tried to cut down on my beef intake in favor of soy protein, imitation burgers, and chicken.

&gt;As for doing my best... I mean, again, we get to protests. My best will still involve consumption of the things produced from systems I am inherently against because, again, we have no choice.

Instead, look the report IRENA publishes every year on Power Generation, like [this](https://www.irena.org/publications/2022/Jul/Renewable-Power-Generation-Costs-in-2021). Check the graphs about LCOE (utility-scale) \[Levelized cost of electicity\]. Solar has been for years comparable with Fossil fuels. The main problems are 1) We are talking about converting *huge* shares of the power market, that doesn't happen in a year or two. 2) Small yield in winter season. 3) At some point we'll have to compromise and accept fossils to balance the grid or invest heavily in storage systems.

Nothing wrong with saying Solar isn't perfect, but saying it doesn't work and it's just greenwashing is bad and very lazy propaganda.

122,"**ExxonMobil loses bid to dismiss AG Healey's climate change lawsuit**

Massachusetts’ highest court on Tuesday rejected a bid by ExxonMobil to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the state that accuses the oil giant of misleading the public about the role its fossil fuels play in causing climate change.

The lawsuit filed in 2019 by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleges Exxon launched an effort, “reminiscent of the tobacco industry’s long denial campaign about the dangerous effects of cigarettes,” to deceive consumers and investors about climate change.

Massachusetts’ Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling that rejected the company’s argument that a state law shielded it from the lawsuit.

A phone message seeking comment was left with Exxon, which has denied spreading disinformation about the contribution of fossil fuels to global warming.

In a congressional hearing last year, the company's CEO, Darren Woods, told lawmakers that its public statements on climate “are and have always been truthful” and that Exxon has “long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change” and ""devoted significant resources to addressing those risks.″

The Massachusetts lawsuit says Exxon engaged in a “sophisticated, multi-million dollar campaign” to sow doubt in climate science and downplay the link between fossil fuels and climate change. The lawsuit says Exxon also undertook “greenwashing campaigns” in an effort to portray itself as environmentally responsible.

“Rather than honestly disclose and mitigate climate change risks, ExxonMobil’s misrepresentations about and failures to disclose those risks have delayed the needed transition to clean energy around the world and make these existential climate-driven threats to the global economy more likely to occur,” the complaint says.

Healey called the court's ruling a “resounding victory” in the state's efforts to “stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers.”

“Exxon’s repeated attempts to stonewall our lawsuit have been baseless, and this effort was no different. We look forward to proceeding with our case and having our day in court to show how Exxon is breaking the law and to put an end to the deception once and for all,” she said in a statement.

Lawyers for Exxon argued in court documents that the company’s statements about climate change and energy policy were “protected petitioning activity” even if they were made to defend the company’s reputation.

But the top court said the law Exxon claimed should protect the company in this case doesn't apply to government enforcement actions brought by the attorney general.

- getting off fossil fuels, in my opinion, *isn’t* worth it if the solution is more damaging.
- creating biofuels does not get us off fossil fuels, it merely adds to them. Anti-fossil fuel regulation is the only way to “break the chain”, but as long as the industry can promise that they’ll act without the need for regulation, then they can dupe us into thinking it’s not necessary which brings me to my next point about industry promises
- the industry’s net zero by 2050 forecast for SAFs can be summarised as follows: do almost nothing for 15 years then miraculously ramp up “sustainable” fuel production for just-in-time net zero at 2050. This will mean that by the time we hit 2035 and reach this fabled ramp up, and we finally realise that it is totally unachievable, and worse for the planet, it’ll be too late. In parallel all current company execs will have comfortably retired and shareholders will have already made a tidy sum of money from the preceding 15 years of business as usual. 
- I also disagree with the notion that we can’t expect rapid change. This is one of the fossil fuel industry’s favourite narratives to spread, and it has been working for the last several decades as they’ve dragged their feet as much as possible. People in face to face conversations and in Reddit threads should stop reinforcing this narrative since it is self fulfilling. 

My solutions are as follows: educate people that, contrary to what adverts tells us, new technology and innovations from large companies cannot alone invent us out of a climate catastrophe. This means getting really tough on greenwash and false techno-optimistic solutions which should also help create an appetite for strong regulation. It also means stopping the focus of sustainability being on how much green stuff you do, but instead on how much not green stuff you don’t do. It seems simple, but the narrative almost always centres around, for example, more electric cars, more electric planes, more solar panels, rather than fewer petrol cars, less coal. One more electric car ≠ one less petrol one. Only one less petrol car = one less petrol car. The alternative could be anything or nothing, but the environment only cares about the reduction GHGs. E.g. I could have a fleet of 5 petrol cars. That’s 100% petrol cars. I could then buy 10 EVs (sounds great) and now I’m at 33% petrol cars (also sounds great), but no improvement to combating climate change has been made. So that’s why I call this kind of publicity out as the greenwash it is. In terms of technically what needs doing, we need to curb growth in flying and start flying less, unfortunately. The day flying can be truly green will be 30+ years at least from now. At that point maybe it can have a renaissance. As you can see, it’s not a terribly optimistic view, but at least it might help us avoid the worst of the climate catastrophe.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/jon-stewart-veterans-burn-pits-gop-cruelty/?utm_source=reddit.com

&gt;Senate Republicans last week provided Americans with a vivid example of their party’s abject cruelty when they rejected the PACT Act, which would provide veterans with benefits to cover the health consequences they endured from exposure to burn pits while serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. They did so even though many of those same Republicans approved a nearly identical bill in June.

&gt;For a tutorial on how to respond to the lies and heartlessness Republicans have shown here, Democrats should turn to an unlikely source: comedian Jon Stewart.

&gt;The GOP’s reversal on the bill seems to be motivated by payback. Republicans voted against the PACT Act because they were angry over the agreement between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the Inflation Reduction Act, the reconciliation package that includes tax hikes on the wealthy, subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage and investment in green energy. The deal was announced just hours after the Senate passed its bipartisan bill to enhance national security and U.S. competitiveness against China by investing in semiconductor manufacturing.

&gt;Jon Stewart joined Democratic lawmakers in the District on July 28 after Senate Republicans blocked a new plan to help millions of veterans. (Video: The Washington Post)
In other words, Republicans threw a temper tantrum because they would no longer be able to hold the semiconductor bill hostage to block passage of the Democrats’ popular agenda. Think about that for a second. Republicans took their frustrations with Democrats out on sick veterans. That’ll show them!

&gt;In the days since the GOP stalled the bill, Stewart was unflinching. He went in front of cameras on Thursday to express what many Americans were feeling. Regarding Republicans’ about-face on the bill, Stewart said he was used to the “hypocrisy,"" “lies” and “cowardice” of politicians, but “I am not used to the cruelty.”

&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) offered a patently false excuse that the bill would create “pork.” In fact, the funds are delineated for a specific purpose. As Stewart tweeted: “The PACT Act is a stand alone bill. The PACT Act has no spending unrelated to Veteran’s Health and Benefits. There is no ‘Pork.’ There is no budget maneuver that then allows Dems to backfill [with] whatever they want.”

&gt;Stewart, appearing on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, kept up the barrage:

 
&gt;Republicans will likely come crawling back to approve the bill now that they have been exposed as deceitful, malicious and petulant. But Democrats should learn from Stewart and apply his techniques in other contexts.


&gt;In the abortion realm, Democrats should be clear. It is the height of dishonesty to say that abortion bans, which would endanger women’s health and lives, are “pro-life.” And it is simply untrue that these bills are about preventing abortions moments before delivery, as so many Republicans claim. The Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban third-trimester abortions. All but a handful already did before the Dobbs decision. One percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks and far fewer in the third trimester. It is a lie to say abortion causes women emotional distress or physical injury or that abortion is dangerous.

&gt;And it is cruel and barbaric to demand that a teen rape victim endure pregnancy and labor or to demand a woman with chronic health conditions risk pregnancy. Only monsters would insist that doctors wait until women are so sick that they might die before they can receive appropriate medical treatment, which includes abortions.

&gt;Stewart is a gifted communicator. His basic approach — righteous anger, blunt language, mastery of the facts, determination to call out the GOP’s bad faith — is something all Democrats should follow, whether the topic is veterans’ health, abortion, the Jan. 6 insurrection, guns, climate change or just about anything else. Enough is enough.

144,"&gt;Film star Brendan Gleeson has said Ireland needs to show some self-respect and reclaim its valuable oil, gas and fish resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emmy award winner said he was inspired to support a new documentary The Atlantic after witnessing the bullying and slow death of coastal communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;The feature-length film - from the maker of The Pipe, which explored Shell's Corrib Gas project in Co Mayo - examines the exploitation of finite resources off Irish shores, and Newfoundland and Norway.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it gets unprecedented whistle-blower access to the workings of a super-trawler - a mammoth factory ship which drags nets the size of football pitches to scoop up tonnes of fish at a time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said: "" I feel that we haven't valued either the resources or the communities that can live from them.  
&gt;  
&gt;""What I meant by self-respect was in our own terms of self-respect, as a nation in looking after the communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are hammering the small man and we are legitimising these massive factory ships.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson was encouraged to take part in the documentary after spending time in Newfoundland filming the Grand Seduction where he saw ageing, seaside communities with little future, as cod quotas remain closed.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These communities are dying on their feet. The moratorium has destroyed the whole culture and way of life,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's just patently appalling and patently wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;""But I was really inspired to what they did in response. They showed a sense of self respect that we have not really done here.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Documentary film-maker Richie O Domhnaill, a theoretical physics graduate and TV cameraman, travelled to Arranmore, where he spent time with local fisherman Jerry Early.  
&gt;  
&gt;The nets man was prosecuted for catching salmon at sea while for several months of the year he watches gigantic trawlers pull vast quantities of white fish from the depths a few miles offshore.  
&gt;  
&gt;""They are not being policed,"" Gleeson said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's one rule for the big boys and one rule for the small boys.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Under a European trade-off for increased farming benefits Ireland gifts about a billion euro worth of fish from its seas every year to other EU countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said protecting the sea's resources has to take precedence over ""some dodgy stuff that was done in the 80s"" referring to Ireland's tax write -offs for oil and gas exploration at sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the film O Domhnaill also visited the tiny Canadian village of Renews and spent time in Norway with Bjornar Nicolaisen who offered a careful and philosophical outlook on the use of the Atlantic's resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gleeson said his experience of coastal communities was that they were dying out as big business capitalises on the seas.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We always took pride ourselves in standing up in the face of bullies and I think we are being bullied now,"" he said.

&gt; It's amusing that you think being a plutocrat is now a validation of what he's saying when he says something you agree with; the seeming assumption that conservatives would agree with something if only such a plutocrat would say it, and finally your apparent lack of awareness of just how liberal much of our plutocracy is.

&gt; It's like you've drunk your own kool-aid about the ""1%"" and actually believe conservatives are beholden to some cabal of spectacularly wealthy bond villains rather than being normal people from all walks of life that merely disagree with you about government policy.


It's validation because it isn't something I've heard one say aloud before. I've heard more of Donald Trumps drivel than stuff like what this guy says. Anyway, I'm not denying that wealthy people aren't liberal. I talked about it before in one of my comments in this thread: I blamed certain administrations for failing to tax wealthy in a way that is fair over wealthy people themselves. 


&gt; You need to get out more: talk to people who aren't just like you, read books by people you disagree with. And, not just as ""opposition research"" to hunt down little hypocrisies and stupid statements you can use to bash them. Honestly consider the things they say, suspend your disbelief for a while and pretend you don't already disagree with them so you can actually listen and understand their point. They're not always as nuts or as stupid as you think they are.


Oh trust me, I do. That's why I'm here. I've posted here about a dozen times. I read /r/conservative (it does make my blood boil, admittedly). I've had plenty of in person debates with conservatives (all my coworkers were Republicans from the US at one point as I live overseas). Yes, 99% of the people I've met in my life are politically left wing and the ones that aren't are usually way older than me or not in a position where I can shoot the shit with them, but among people I know, I'm the only one who actively goes out and looks for the conservative opinion. 


I also know a lot of insanely stupid left leaning folk, too. 


&gt; I'm sorry I'm being so dismissive, but I ""honestly can't fathom"" how anyone can be so narrow minded that they end up as befuddled as you profess to be about the thinking of people on the other side of the debate while simultaneously exhibiting such ignorance about who those people actually are.


I hear way more hardcore Bible thumping, evolution/climate change/moon landing denying, homophobic, racist, intolerant, selfish, Glenn Beck parroting, Tea Party-ish rhetoric from the right than anything else. Twenty times more. Seriously. If a liberal doesn't actively go searching for conservative opinions like I'm doing right now, that's all you hear coming from the right (and it is partly the left's fault as the extreme right is what gets fixated on in liberal media). That's a large part of the reason people on the left have their heads up their own asses. It feels like the other side is hiding in caves in Montana with ham radios, trying to convince the rest of the world that the second coming of Christ is upon us. 


When I lived in Japan the only English station on the radio was AFN. Every evening when I was driving home from work, Rush Limbaugh would be on air for about an hour and I would listen to the whole thing. It made my blood boil without fail. I've been feeling a huge amount of cognitive dissonance over it as on the one hand, the only conservative opinion I ever hear sounds like absolute lunacy to me. On the other hand, I know that these people are intelligent, three dimensional people like anyone else, I've just never had an opportunity to actually level with them and all I hear from their side comes out of the mouth of people like Sarah Palin. It's actually hard to find level headed conservatives who aren't fixated on the social dimension. Hence me coming here. 


&gt; Don't get me wrong, this isn't about liberal or conservative. I've run into way too many conservatives who are just as myopic and willfully ignorant about the arguments (and the merits to those arguments) made by the other side and it bugs the hell out of me.


I think part of the problem is that both sides only hear one narrative that represents the other side. On the left, we only hear Tea Party-esque rhetoric coming from the right. On the right, the left probably looks like a bunch of beret wearing vegan hipsters or something. 


It doesn't help that the west, specifically the US, is more politically divided than any other point in centuries.

179,"Considering I have a genetic disease which prevents me from being able to obtain some of the nutrients required to survive from plants. Only being able to absorb enough to live from a high fat diet. It may as well be magic. If you think I am alone in this you might want to read up on the number of people on the planet who would literally die without meat.

You might want to also look up the explosion in the rate of diabetes among the populations of countries where grains make up the majority of their daily caloric intake. Human beings aren't meant to survive on on a diet consisting primarily of complex carbs. Yes it's possible to do so but it causes serious health problems in the long run.

As I said, yes the planet needs to reduce its meat consumption but that isn't far off from the current consumption levels overall. The majority of meat consumed is concentrated in certain countries but if those were reduced and everyone was to eat balanced diets. Instead of surviving on rice and beans the overall consumption levels would not change much. Dramatically reducing the consumption of meat to transition people to plant based diets is going to result in trading human lives for animal lives. 

No, growing up on a farm isn't how I obtained an education regarding nutrition, biology, or ethics.

Thats a tough call. 

The vegan who contributes to the factory farm system that kills millions of animals a year and is accelerating climate change. In order to obtain specific vegan products, rather than obtaining a balanced diet from the local community. 

Versus the hunter who kills 2-3 animals a year under the supervision of the department of environmental conservation. Paying for tags which provide funding for the departments conservation efforts. Which helps keep the entire animal population healthy. While taking on the direct personal responsibility of minimizing any animal suffering that is needed in order for them to be able to eat.

ROTTERDAM, 1. NOV, 09:21
Following an industry push, the European Union seems set to explore ways to recycle CO2, through a technique called carbon capture and utilisation (CCU).
However, some warn that CCU needs to be better classified, otherwise the method can turn out to be nothing more than an accounting trick that does little to reduce emissions.

The concept of CCU is closely linked to carbon capture and storage (CCS), which has been very slow to get off the ground in the EU.
But instead of storing the CO2 molecules deep underground, as some European regions are planning to do, CCU takes those molecules and uses them as raw materials.

The concept has its supporters, like Alan Knight, general manager corporate responsibility at steel giant ArcellorMittal.

At the Companies vs Climate Change Conference in Brussels last month, Knight said he preferred CCU to CCS.

""Why store it? Why landfill carbon? I thought landfill was quite [at the] bottom on the waste hierarchy?""

The waste hierarchy is a concept from the circular economy field, which says that landfill of waste should be the ultimate option, after having tried reusing, repairing, and recycling.

He said CCU was a ""really interesting solution"", in particular when comparing it to CCS, which requires paying someone to store the CO2.

""If we can turn CO2 into something we could sell, we would be incentivised to do it,"" said Knight.

From cola to tomatoes
CCU is already applied in some sectors.

The CO2 in fizzy drinks is sometimes captured from industrial processes.

In the Netherlands, CO2 from industries operating in the port of Rotterdam is transported to the nearby Westland area, where it is used as a literal greenhouse gas, to help stimulate the growth of vegetables.

The EU is getting ready to increase its support for the development of CCU through a new Innovation Fund that will be part of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) from 2021 onwards.

The fund is the successor to the NER300 fund, which was supposed to help set up CCS projects across Europe, but failed to do so because member states did not finance their part.

Originally, the European Commission proposed that the innovation fund would be open only to CCS initiatives and ""demonstration projects of innovative renewable energy technologies.

But both the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, where member states meet, propose that CCU projects should also be eligible.

The EU institutions will meet again next Wednesday (8 November) to negotiate further on the ETS.

A spokeswoman for Estonia, which holds the six-month rotating presidency, said ""agreement is yet to be reached"" but a source in the parliament said the inclusion of CCU in the fund was ""not controversial"" and that the institutions agree.

""We are pretty sure, let's say 99.5 [percent], ... that CCS and CCU will be part of that Innovation Fund,"" EU commission official Mark van Stiphout said last Thursday (26 November) at a conference on CCS in Rotterdam.

It is not entirely clear why CCU was not originally part of the commission proposal, but its proposed inclusion has been welcomed by industrial lobby groups.

The latest compromise text on the innovation fund specified that CCU projects eligible should be ""environmentally safe"" and contribute ""substantially to mitigate climate change"".

What substantially means will have to be further defined.

""CCU is a way too wide concept. If you try to approach that with one size fits all measures from governments, then we are going to get a lot of greenwashing and bad stuff, that's for sure,"" he said.

At the Rotterdam conference, Jacek Podkanski, a senior engineer at the European Investment Bank (EIB), said the bank would finance CCU projects ""in theory"", but that each project would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

A lot depends on the life cycle of the product made with CO2, and the period during which the CO2 is kept out of the atmosphere.

If the CO2 is put in a product but then released to the atmosphere a few years later, the procedure has done little to help limit climate change.

CO2-to-fuels
One CCU application in that category that worried Helseth is using captured CO2 to make fuels.

The EU has funded research into this, through its Horizon 2020 science fund.

Steelanol, a project that tries to produce bioethanol from CO2 emitted by steel plants, received €10.2 million in 2015.

The biggest company involved in the project is ArcelorMittal. When this website asked to visit the project's site in Ghent and to receive more information, it was told to ask again at the beginning of next year.

CO2-to-fuels may also receive a boost through another piece of EU rules currently in the legislative pipeline: the renewable energy directive is currently being considered by the parliament and council.

Don't get too excited
Stuart McKay, head of CCS and hydrogen policy at the Scottish government said at the CCS conference in Rotterdam he was ""a bit concerned"" about CCU.

""What I'm worried about is that people outside this room may start to get confused and think that there is a choice between CCS or CCU. I recognise CCS as a climate mitigation tool. I don't quite recognise CCU in the same way.""

Participants of the conference also seemed to agree that while CCU could be an addition to CCS, it was not likely to be a solution that can be applied to reduce emissions in the order of magnitude needed to avert catastrophic climate disruptions.

""I would not get too excited about that,"" said the EIB's Jacek Podkanski.

David Hone, chief climate change adviser at fossil fuel giant Shell, said CCU could help reduce the price of the technology to capture CO2, which could be a stepping stone to CCS.

He too warned against seeing CCU as a silver bullet.

207,"You're right in that it's largely a matter of semantics.

With the basketball analogy, I completely agree. The two players have equal opportunity to dunk the ball. I'm sure there is a 5'5"" guy out there who has worked hard on his jump height, and is capable of dunking. It's a hell of a lot easier for the 7'6"" guy, but...that's how life is.

You mention how liberals/progressives want to help the 5'5"" guy, rather than hurt the 7'6"" guy, but that's not how progressive policy works in execution. Instead, progressive policies punish the 7'6"" guy, and give a cut from that to the 5'5"" guy. Or, alternatively, they move the rim up for the 7'6"" guy, or move it down for the 5'5"" guy.

I disagree with this entire philosophy. The rim is 10 feet high. If you can't dunk, and aren't willing to put in the effort necessary to be able to dunk, it isn't our job to lower the rim so you can dunk. 

Either earn it, or try something else. Not everyone is born to dunk. There is a reason why you don't see a ton of Asians or Jewish guys in the NBA, and it isn't because there is systemic inequality with a 10' rim due to different racial backgrounds having different average heights. Likewise, the reason why you don't see a ton of Changs or Nakamuras playing wide receiver isn't because football is unfair. Asians have equal opportunity to throw on pads and catch footballs. They just have a much more difficult path to making the cut. That doesn't mean we need to impose a maximum total inches in height cap on teams to try and lower the bar so that it's easier for short people to make the NFL. It just means that if you're a 5'3"" Chinese dude who wants to be a star wideout, you're going to have to make sure you never drop a single ball, and that you're the fastest dude in the field. 

I think the difference here is when I say equal opportunity, I don't mean that every single person has the exact same statistical odds of success. That is unrealistic. Even if we had a ""The Giver"" society where there were no parents, no property, total wealth equity, and absolutely no material differences in wealth or resources from person to person, people would still have different odds of success based on genetic traits. Someone who is the child of 2 olympians will have a far better chance of also being a superstar athlete than someone who is the child of two obese, diabetic, and heart diseased individuals. When I say equality of opportunity, I mean that the avenues are available to you. Every single person should be able to apply to college. You shouldn't be barred from even applying based on class, race, or religion. Every person should be allowed to start a business. We shouldn't ban certain groups from ownership of property, or from investing. Every person should be able to make it into the NHL, if they prove they have the ability. We shouldn't have ""must be 6' to enter"" rules for athletes. Every person should be allowed equal opportunity to succeed, in that the opportunity should be made available to all, regardless of who their parents are, where they are from, how much they make, what their job is, or what their education level is.

I think what you're talking about is equality in the level of difficulty in taking advantage of opportunity. That's just not realistic, in my view, and it damages the efficiency of everything it touches. There is a reason why you don't see short guys in the NBA, or women playing at linebacker. It isn't because the system of professional sports is unfair or discriminatory. If a short guy can shoot 95% from anywhere on the court, he will certainly find a spot on an NBA roster. If a woman can consistently make key stops in the open field, stuff the gap, and read plays, she will find a spot on an NFL roster. It's just that the difficulty in doing these things are incredibly high. It doesn't mean we need to change the sport. It means that short guys or NFL-hopeful women need to either be prepared to work harder than anyone else, or that they need to redirect their efforts and create more efficient goals.

As for the car example, I was showing how private consumers responded to a well-known environmental scandal. You say the scandal was from them breaking government rules. While that's partially true, the real scandal for the average consumer was that VW was producing extremely polluting vehicles. Even people who don't agree with climate change theory (or people who think it's exaggerated) were put off by VW's cars deliberately putting out genuine pollutants that cause acid rain and smog. The stock may have crashed due to fear of massive civil and criminal penalties against the corporation (even then, I would argue that a big part of the crash was due to anticipation of sales tanking, which has nothing to do with the government), but the sales crashed because individual consumers lost their trust in VW as a company. People didn't think to themselves, ""man, I really want a Jetta, but VW is going to get seriously fined by the EPA and they violated a battery of U.S. and EU laws, so I guess I'll settle for a Camry."" They made a personal decision to not financially support a company that lied to its consumers, because they were disgusted with the blatant and intentional deception. Even if the government issued no penalties, and if no law existed regarding emissions, the scandal would've still come out. It was a group of student researchers that uncovered the whole thing, not government investigators. VW successfully duped the government the whole time. It took independent inspectors that were making a paper on the accuracy of advertising (IIRC) to find the defeat device. I don't see why the consumer that decided to stop buying VW cars would've not done so in the absence of government regulation. They would've done the exact same thing: refuse to give money to a company that blatantly lied about its product.

211,"# “A Huge Mistake.” The E.U. Jeopardizes its Climate Goals By Labeling Natural Gas as Green

By *Ciara Nugent*

A long-simmering debate about the future of natural gas has been forced to a head in Europe this month, as the E.U. considers classifying some projects involving the fossil fuel as sustainable investments in official advice for the private sector due to be published by the end of January.


Burning natural gas produces carbon dioxide—but around 50% less than burning coal. The E.U. gets 22% of its energy from natural gas, and to meet its ambitious climate targets, the European Commission says it needs to cut use of the fuel by 37% by 2030. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, says the world needs to stop all investment in new gas and oil projects from 2021 onwards in order to keep on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050.


So it surprised many when, on Dec. 31, a draft version of the E.U.’s green energy taxonomy—a long-awaited list of investments the bloc considers sustainable for the planet—said that natural gas projects should count as green under certain conditions. (Nuclear energy, which does not emit greenhouse gases but carries other environmental risks, also got a controversial inclusion).


On. Jan 12, a coalition of influential investors including BlackRock, Vanguard and most of the world’s largest asset managers sent an open letter to E.U. representatives urging them to rethink the inclusion of natural gas in the taxonomy. “It is our view that the proposals in the [draft] would seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance, potentially triggering a ‘race to the bottom’,” the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change wrote, “which could dilute the level of climate ambition within emerging jurisdictional taxonomies.”


With the private sector trying to overhaul its spending to meet a deluge of environmental pledges made in recent years, the goal of the taxonomy is to guide money to the right places and hasten the energy transition.


The taxonomy, a technical document, has become a political battleground for warring visions between member states over the future of natural gas. One side—including many Central and Eastern European countries and Italy—argues that Europe needs to invest more in natural gas as a “bridge fuel” from even-dirtier coal and oil to a fully clean energy future. The other side—including Sweden, Austria, Spain, Ireland and others—says that the E.U. needs to discourage investment in all fossil fuels including gas inside its borders, and instead channel every available resource into ramping up renewables, which make up only around 17% of Europe’s energy supply.


The debate has divided the E.U.’s two largest economies. Germany’s government, a coalition including the Green party, has said the draft taxonomy amounts to “greenwashing,” while France has backed it, largely because it includes nuclear energy, the country’s main energy source.


The draft text has sparked fierce backlash from environmentalists across the bloc, who warn that the E.U.’s green credentials for gas—even with conditions attached—will have implications far beyond the natural gas market in Europe, confusing investors around the world and providing cover for the fossil fuel industry in developing countries.


”As a bloc, we are losing a lot of the legitimacy we need to convince others to shift their policies in order to achieve climate sustainability,” says Mounir Satouri, a Green member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France. “This is a huge mistake.”


## The case for natural gas as a transitional fuel

Wind and solar power are becoming very cheap to install, but we still lack some of the technology to store their energy for longer periods when the wind isn’t blowing or sun isn’t shining. Advocates for natural gas argue that it’s easy to store, and power plants running on the fuel can be turned off and on as needed, making it a great complement to renewables for the next decade or so.


The E.U.’s taxonomy labels natural gas as a “transitional fuel,” and investments in it will count as green if power plants produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour and are equipped to burn lower carbon gases, such as green hydrogen. Any new natural gas project must also replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31, 2030.


The green label “will certainly unlock some investment. But that will be very focalized in those markets where there’s still quite a lot of reliance on coal: in central and eastern Europe and perhaps Germany,” says Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of global gas research at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.


The E.U. aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 in order to stay on track to avoid the worst of climate change. Classing some natural gas as green is a pragmatic decision to help coal-reliant member states shift off coal more quickly and meet that target, according to Christian Ehler, a German MEP from the center-right European People’s Party. “Poland is not jumping from coal to wind [turbines]—there will be a step in between. So politically there needs to be a compromise,” he says. “If a national energy mix includes gas in order to fulfill the 55% ambitions, why should that harm either the environment or the commonly formulated goals? I think this politics of symbolism has to come to an end if you really want to reach those goals.”


## Muddying the green waters

But environmentalists reject the idea that natural gas is needed as a bridge fuel. “This transitional mentality arguing in favor of ‘less bad’ energy forces could have worked a couple of decades ago,” says Jakop Dalunde, a Green MEP from Sweden. “But today, in a climate emergency, we have to have full focus on energy sources that are truly sustainable.”


Granting natural gas a “green stamp,” he adds, could divert money from investments in clean energy—a problem, given renewables capacity needs to expand by 12% ever year to stay on track for net zero at 2050, per the IEA. “This [taxonomy] is about the long-term future we want to encourage. Fossil fuels have no place there.”


Though the taxonomy includes fairly stringent conditions for natural-gas projects to be classed as green, campaigners are concerned that it will be difficult to hold projects accountable for meeting them, says Tsvetelina Kuzmanova, a sustainable finance policy advisor at European climate think tank E3G. For example, power plants would need to switch to 100% low-carbon gases by 2035 under the rules, but the technology does not yet exist to run a gas power plant only with low carbon gases, so it is unclear how a gas project seeking green funding in the present would prove it can eventually do that.


Kuzmanova says that any expansion of natural gas poses a threat to the E.U.’s short-term goal on methane—a potent greenhouse gas with 80 times the warming power of CO2—which is the main component of natural gas. At COP26, the U.N. climate conference last November, the E.U. pledged to cut its methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Leaks from natural gas infrastructure are one major source of methane emissions, while the rest mostly come from agriculture. “Reducing natural gas infrastructure really should be the low-hanging fruit on methane,” Kuzmanova says.


## The impact beyond Europe

Climate campaigners also worry about the wider signal that the move sends on the urgency of phasing out gas. The E.U. has presented itself as a climate leader for the world in recent years, says Marie Toussaint, a Green MEP from France. “If we then say natural gas can be a sustainable investment, the message that other countries get is that it’s still okay to keep producing gas for many years,” she says, adding that other governments may follow the E.U.’s example but fail to impose the same limiting conditions on gas investments.


Analysts say policy makers in South Korea followed the E.U.’s discussion closely when drafting their own sustainable energy taxonomy, published in December, which also classifies natural gas as a transitional fuel.


And, though the taxonomy is meant only as advice to the private sector, Toussaint says she sees its influence in other E.U. legislation that lawmakers are reviewing as part of the European Green Deal. The European Investment Bank also aligns its lending with the taxonomy.


For Dalunde, the Swedish MEP, a taxonomy that includes natural gas is a wasted opportunity to deliver the level of climate ambition the world urgently needs. “This taxonomy had the potential to be one of the most consequential decisions that we take on climate change, not only for Europe, but globally, because other nations will take inspiration from it,” says Dalunde. “It could have been a quiet revolution. But the inclusion of fossil gas would really undermine that.”",0,2,0,2,"The article discusses the European Union's decision to label natural gas as a green investment, which is seen as contradictory to its climate goals.

From this [article](https://georgelakoff.com/2016/11/22/a-minority-president-why-the-polls-failed-and-what-the-majority-can-do/):

&gt;In politics, institutions, and cultural life, words tend not to be neutral. Instead their meanings are defined with respect to political world-views. There are conservative and liberal vocabularies. “Save the planet!” is liberal. “Energy independence” is a conservative ‘dog whistle.’ It means dig coal and drill for oil and gas, even on public lands, and don’t invest seriously in solar and wind. Some might think those are politically neutral expressions. If you take them literally and ignore worldview differences, you might think everyone should want to save the planet and everyone should want energy independence. Liberals want literal energy independence, but through sustainable energy like solar and wind. Conservatives don’t believe in man-made climate change and want energy independence through maximizing coal, gas, and oil. Politically charged meanings put the other side in a bind. The opposition cannot answer directly. You won’t hear conservatives say “I don’t want to save the planet,” nor liberals say, “I’m against energy independence.” Instead they have to change the frame.  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, negating a frame just activates the frame and makes it stronger. I wrote a book called “Don’t Think of an Elephant!” to make that point. Liberals are often caught in this trap. If a conservative says, “we should have tax relief,” she is using the metaphor that taxation is an affliction that we need relief from. If a liberal replies, “No, we don’t need tax relief,” she is accepting the idea that taxation is an affliction. The first thing that is, or should be, taught about political language is not to repeat the language of the other side or negate their framing of the issue.

&gt;Some high religious fundamentalists turn up in all the faiths represented in my samples, including Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. Within Christianity, I always find some Catholics scoring highly on the Religious Fundamentalism scale, a few Anglicans post big numbers, some Lutherans ring the bell, and so on. But in study after study the high scores pile up far more often in the conservative Protestant denominations than anywhere else, among Baptists, Mennonites, Pentecostals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Alliance Church, and so on. It bears repeating that this is a generalization, and some Baptists, etcetera score quite low in fundamentalism. But if you want to make a safe wager, see what odds you can get betting that these conservative sects will score higher on the Religious Fundamentalism scale than the other major Christian groups.

(page 139)

&gt;This chapter has presented my main research findings on religious fundamentalists. The first thing I want to emphasize, in light of the rest of this book, is that they are highly likely to be authoritarian followers. They are highly submissive to established authority, aggressive in the name of that authority, and conventional to the point of insisting everyone should behave as their authorities decide. They are fearful and self-righteous and have a lot of hostility in them that they readily direct toward various out-groups. They are easily incited, easily led, rather un-inclined to think for themselves, largely impervious to facts and reason, and rely instead on social support to maintain their beliefs. They bring strong loyalty to their in-groups, have thick-walled, highly compartmentalized minds, use a lot of double standards in their judgments, are surprisingly unprincipled at times, and are often hypocrites.  
&gt;  
&gt;But they are also Teflon-coated when it comes to guilt. They are blind to themselves, ethnocentric and prejudiced, and as closed-minded as they are narrow-minded. They can be woefully uninformed about things they oppose, but they prefer ignorance and want to make others become as ignorant as they. They are also surprisingly uninformed about the things they say they believe in, and deep, deep, deep down inside many of them have secret doubts about their core belief. But they are very happy, highly giving, and quite zealous. In fact, they are about the only zealous people around nowadays in North America, which explains a lot of their success in their endless (and necessary) pursuit of converts.

I agree, we aren't really doing anything that's helping. But we are trying despite general exhaustion with the state of the world (and draconian restrictions put in place by those in power. In Australia, there are laws that restrict protests).

Are baby boomers doing anything? Did I miss something?

&gt; I wonder how much of the environment feels any of you would have when actual restrictive measures would be taken and so reductions of life style. Besides, are we talking about western relatively rich and well positioned younger generations or the whole world? 

Lots of younger people, including myself, are adopting a life of minimalism and would prefer say, living in a repurposed shipping container over owning a mansion.

&gt; If we are talking about US - well, younger generation there just had the rare opportunity to elect a truly progressive and just candidate which would surely beat Trump in next elections and they have totally failed to even fucking vote. But complaining on the internet about it? Mmm-mm. From the fucking couch. 

I'm in Australia, but am following the US situation. I am appalled that Bernie is not SMASHING the polls. I blame the established Deep State for keeping someone like Biden in the running, in conjunction with the mainstream media's clearly biased coverage. Are you also forgetting the fact that older generations get to vote too?

Bless Eric and the rest of the pirate radio movement for trying. Oh yeah - that seems to me like a damn good effort on the side of Millenials in answering your previous question (see Red Scare podcast, FriendlyJordies (Australian political commentator), and more).

&gt; On the whole though, i dont think you can make any relevant judgement or evaluations of personality traits and qualities based on such generalizations. The real differences are in individuals, and always have been.

Sure - whatever you want to believe. I'm just trying to push this conversation forward without doing what you're doing: ""Yeah you guys aren't doing anything either, so shut up and just let the world continue to go to shit"". Bad argument imo with no evidence, anecdotal or reliable.

This is just my perspective from the front lines as a frustrated but hopeful Millenial. I do think you are right here to a large extent (being that things are largely individual). But younger generations are learning at an exponential rate how to be moral and contribute to society (thanks to technology and people like Eric, Joe Rogan, etc. [And please don't argue that Rogan is detrimental to society as some kind of alt. right figure - man's an international treasure]). I consider myself to be one of these Millenials.

I 100% agree with you that Trump is a fascist and is a Russian plant, that his administration has had involvement with Russia. That's undisputed at this point, and what he's done to the EPA is nothing short of obscene.

If Trump knew the pandemic was dangerous but did nothing, and committed politicized, he is beyond evil and a mass murderer (something I've already concluded months ago-- for fuck's sake if I was still Catholic I would have called him the literal Antichrist, and yet he's led astray so many supposed ""Christians"").

The whole thing about the right's rage over Obama is idiotic, and I agree. So many people still (falsely) believe that Obama is Muslim, or that he wasn't born in the US, or that he's a thousand other unsubstantiated things. Many Republicans hate and speak badly of Obama likely just because he's black, and I have family who somehow believe Obama is a Communist when there is zero evidence this is the case, and deny climate change, and say racial slurs.

&gt;For one you can look at the criminal records of all Republican leadership and you will find that they have committed crimes, especially sex crimes with underage children, at more then 4 times(4 times!) The rate that democrat leadership has. If you've never looked at this before you will be absolutely shocked: dozens and dozens and dozens of Republicans in power right now from mayors to governors to congressman have been convicted of raping and molesting and even trafficking children. This is factually not true about the Democrat side of the aisle.

I had no idea so many Republicans were literally child molesters, but I need to see some sources to back up this particular claim, because I can't just take your word without *reputable, unbiased, or minimally biased* sources. It's obvious nowadays that so many Catholic priests or clergy are child molesters, and it's truly sickening that the Vatican/the Church had these priests transferred to other parishes for decades, and not arrested for their crimes. Rather than admit the truth, they chose to hide pure evil under the rug. So much for preaching goodness and holiness. A lot of Hollywood directors, actors, and powerful people are also child molesters or rapists-- and many of them are liberal or lean liberal. But with Republican politicians I draw a blank-- I'm not well versed in the sheer number of pedophile Republicans you claim exist. The only connection I can make is Epstein, because he had connections with many politicians and powerful people on both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump, the Clintons, etc.

If you are correct and can prove your assertions, it's ironic that so many far-right loonies accuse Democrats of leading a pedophile ring (PizzaGate, QAnon, etc), when they themselves are the pedos. It's a classic case of projection.

Edit: I've checked on some sites and some people say that there are just as many Democrat child molesters as Republicans, and mention Jared Fogle and other liberals who also molested kids, but I have had trouble finding a definitive list of Democrats guilty of child abuse. Even if there are 4 times as many Republicans who are guilty of child molestation in comparison to Democrats, as you assert, this shouldn't minimize the guilt and culpability of Democrats who are also culpable of the same crimes, even if incidences of sexual crimes among Dems is comparatively less common or smaller.

Pedophilia exists on all sides of the political spectrum and (should) be considered a non-partisan issue. I think what makes Republicans worse off in this regard is their hypocrisy and excessive religiosity-- they preach moral family values and to follow Jesus but then do horrible things when no one's looking. So not only are Republican pedos disgusting, but they're also liars and hypocrites.

I don't know. I'm open to your thoughts. That list of Republicans is horrifying.

234,"I have been saying this before and always got down voted.  Not just Hybe but BTS as well.  All their so-called activism are performative. 

Hybe/BTS picked and spoke out only on ""safe"" topics, but are silenced on other less ""trendy"" issues, even when the issues are more relevant for them.

For example, how does BLM impact BTS, as Korean citizens, more than the widespread bullying or misogyny problems that are currently rampant in Korea? LGBT rights? Digital sex crime? (Actual Korean ARMY were targeted victims).

What about rising cost of living? Affordable housing? Work life balance? Pressure to be succesful? 

Korean millennials refer to themselves as part of the Sampo generation, a neologism that translates to the “three sacrifice generation” – one where young Koreans feel like they must give up relationships, marriages and children to survive the cut-throat economy. 

The Sampo generation quickly becomes the n-generation with n stands for the increasing additional numerous sacrifices (homeownership, etc.), not just 3, 4 or 5.

[Well, millennial around the world are facing similar social economical issues actually.]

BTS, for a short period of time, was part of the President envoy. They could use this opportunity to have a meaningful discussion with Predisent Moon about the various issues that Korean youths are facing. 

We don't have expectation that BTS or Moon would have solutions, but just an awareness discussion, a planting the seed discussion, a small step start for politicians to focus their efforts, would be nice.

Yet outside of photo ops and media press run for PR, nothing. 

Honestly speaking, I'm generally okay with performative activism as it still has the benefit of raising awareness.

What I'm not okay is the hypocrisis. 

Yes, kpop materialistic overconsumption is bad for the environment overall, but NFTs are so so much worse, esp. when NFTs offer no sentimental value as kpop fans overwhelmingly prefer physical, tangible merchandise like photocards.

Don't be fronting like you care about climate change, then turn around and push NFTs as products.

P.S.

For the blindly devoted BTS/Hybe stans, who love to use fallacies to derail/muddle conversations to defend BTS/Hybe, (fallacy like if you really care about climate change, you shouldn't be buying albums either cuz photobooks kill trees), yes, it'd be nice to stop buy albums and merchandise to save the trees, but pretty sure that those stans would cry foul if no one buying their
 faves' albums.

We have a couple of posts in the past that brought up kpop overconsumption and its environment impact, and the overwhelming responses are always dismissive: 

1. Kpop fans are small potatoes. They don't make any difference. Go after the big corp. Go after the rich billionaires. Hybe is a big corporations, no? BTS are rich, no? But it is still not okay for us to demand social responsibilty from them? 

Or 2. Albums and photobooks don't have as much negative impacts as fossil fuel, deforestation or carbon omission. Go after the ones that have the big impact. Well, NFTs are lot worse for the environment than photobooks. But now we can't fight NFTs either because your fave suddenly support NFTs?

&gt;climate change

Firstly, the TPP includes more stringent environmental protections and standards. But this is a trade agreement for which all members already agreed to the COP Paris climate change agreement. I'm not sure where your issue is here.

&gt;The investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows foreign corporations bypass U.S. law

I hate this argument!!!! ISDS doesn't allow corporations to challenge laws they disagree with. It gives corporations the power to stop countries from violating the free trade agreements. Without an enforcement mechanism, we can't have free trade.

For example, in the 1990's Canada banned the import of a harmful gasoline additive called MMT. The ban was challenged by an American company and was successful. The reason for the challenge was not the ban on the chemical, it was challenged because Canadian companies were allowed to keep selling it while Mexican and American companies could not. This violated NAFTA, and without provisions like ISDS, there is no way to challenge unfair treatment. Without it, there is no point in having a FTA. 

&gt;Does not require all countries to be in full compliance with international labor standards

What it does is enforce higher labor standards than currently exist in developing countries. We give them an incentive to improve. I'm sorry, but you can't expect developing countries to have the same standards as the developed. By making this a condition, you are effectively hindering their economic opportunity. Access to the American Market, economic growth and increased wealth are the best way to improve labor standards and living standards. By asking for first world standards, you are effectively banning them from competing, making the poor poorer, and doing nothing to improve the situation. 

&gt;Does not protect from foreign state-owned and state-subsidized companies and their predatory tactics

Yes it does. Not sure where you got this info. Countries can block predatory behavior which will hold up in any ISDS dispute as a result; so long as there is evidence.

&gt;TPP overrules any ""Buy American"" 

You can't have both protectionism and trade liberalization. This isn't hard to understand. 

&gt;New monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies

Those are actually being forced on Americas allies. America already has the same rules for domestic pharmaceuticals. A lot of TPP partners aren't happy about it but it is a provision that benefits America greatly.

241,"I attended the grassroots event last night in Chicago and I have some thoughts regarding my experience and ways we as a community can encourage and facilitate a more inclusive and diverse base.

First, this was my first Pete-related event and he was quite impressive, as I had expected. The stump speech was more compelling than I had heard in the past; as though he's finding the right language and delivering it with more passion. He hit on the Three Values (Freedom, Security, and Democracy) and delivered the context around why they're important, drive policy, and inform leadership. I also liked how he folded the Douglass Plan, Rural Economy and Health Plans, and Gun Violence Action Plan into the stump speech.

The Q&amp;A was impressive as well, the questions were poignant, their owners were bold and courageous, and Pete's answers were nuanced, direct, and intimate. I'll give a few examples here:

* There was a question from a trans member of the military--whom will be unable to re-enlist given the anti-trans policies of this administration--that centered around how a Pete admin would improve the trans experience and tear down barriers to opportunity. Prior to digging into the answer however, Pete had the audience stand and applaud/thank the questioner for their service and courage; which was heart-warming and inspiring to say the least. If I remember correctly, Pete's answer centered around the passage of the Equality Act, expansion of trans medical services within the military, and that his admin would support and advocate for trans rights.
* A newly minted high school student lamented about how he had to worry about what to do in the event of an active shooter situation, and further asked what Pete would do the allay that fear. At this point, there was a collective 'Oh no' from the crowd, signaling a disappointment that we adults have failed to deliver a safe learning environment for this young adult. Pete responded with that sentiment directly, suggesting that it is a failure of 'the adults' for not delivering solutions that would allow this student to worry about high school, and not whether they will make it home that day. He discussed the failures of the current democratic system for not providing solutions to gun violence that have broad bi-partisan support, suggested ways that system can be adjusted to provide citizens a richer voice in the decision making process of the government (end gerrymandering, reform campaign finance, implement the popular vote, etc.), and further discussed elements from the Gun Violence Action Plan that would be implemented in a Pete admin, but really stressed the Political and Civic action elements that Americans can execute now.
* A twelve year old (maybe ten?) asked about climate change and what we can do to address it. Again, the crowd lamented that we had failed yet another child. Similar to the gun violence question, Pete addressed the failures of adults in delivering meaningful solutions to address the threat of climate change. That this child should be occupied with 12-year old interests, such as twelve year old Pete's interest in space exploration (as a space nerd, I'm heartened to know that Pete was enamored with it as well). Pete went on to suggest his ideas on the Carbon Tax and Dividend, stronger investment in renewable energy generation and storage technologies, re-signing the Paris Climate Accord and starting the community-focused variant within the U.S., and supporting the development of carbon capture technologies for use with sustainable farming practices. One of the most powerful elements of his response, I thought, was the end when he thanked the child for their boldness and explained that the easiest way to get the attention of a politician is to have a child boldly ask hard questions and encouraged her to continue holding himself and other leaders to account for their actions.

Overall, I left impressed, inspired, and excited to support Pete and his campaign.

The second point that I would like to address is the lack of black and brown representation in the crowd, despite being in Bronzeville (a majority black neighborhood on the south side of Chicago). I have seen threads here, threads on twitter, and my peers talk about the disparity and its broader implications. Part of the issue resides in name recognition, community attentiveness to politics, and convenience, but I think this particular event provides an opportunity for our community to learn how to support black and brown voices in the political process, make space for their presence at townhall/grassroot/rally events (especially in a majority-minority communities), and invite them to be involved in and shape this candidacy. As a white person from the north side of the city, I recognize that my being at this event occupied space that could have (and likely should have) been filled by a member of the Bronzeville community. I think the format of the event itself and the opaqueness of the marketing (and potentially lack there-of) contribute to this lack of representation. First, the cost of a ticket presents an immediate barrier for someone to attend, especially once the cheaper levels are sold out. If marketing is not strong and members of the community are unable to purchase tickets in advance, their ability to attend is hindered, which leads to my second observation: marketing and outreach. Prior to purchasing the ticket, I was unaware of the location of the event. It would not have deterred me from attending, but it certainly would have made me think twice about occupying space. More broadly though, it seems that these types of events are not well publicized (despite the event space being at capacity) and a thread from a family who lived in a building next door suggests that they were unaware of the event in the first place.

As supporters of Pete however, I think we can be of service in addressing these issues. The first is by way of encouraging the campaign to make changes to the format/outreach/marketing and so forth and by having conversations 'on the ground' with our friends, family, and broader community (esp those of color), and invite them to the proverbial table. We could accomplish the first by suggesting potential solutions (to the campaign) that make these events more convenient and compelling to a diverse crowd and to the members of the hosting community. These solutions may include a set of subsidized (free) tickets that could be disseminated among the host community by community leaders (such as Rev. Chris Harris whom Pete met with some weeks back to discuss his concerns within the Bronzeville community), a broader outreach effort to reach more members of the community and invite them to attend, and a more transparent and accessible marketing effort for the events such that location and time are easily available to those interested in attending. (My guess is that the location is withheld until purchase because of security concerns?) The second element of 'on the ground' efforts is fairly straight forward. Talking to people you know in your community, in your friend groups, and so forth about Pete and how they could be part of the campaign and shape it too. Much to Rev. Harris' chagrin, the crowd last night needed more black and brown representation and he suggested inviting our black and brown friends and family to a future event (or expanding our social circles in case none are included).

Now, I recognize that this event has a dual purpose of fundraising and Pete Outreach. Providing free tickets to members of a community may not be viable at scale for this type of event, but rather it suggests that the campaign may need to hold more free events, like townhalls, rallies, or meet and greets. We know that Pete is putting in the work to understand the issues of Black and Brown Americans; meeting them where they are, empathizing as best he can with their concerns, and diligently seeking to address those concerns with solutions that can work at scale (a la Douglass Plan). I think we as a community can contribute mightily in bringing more people to the campaign, whether by our own efforts or by encouraging the campaign to operate a little differently, and give Pete a hand in his effort to usher in a new era for the country.

These of course are my own thoughts.

244,"
Long ago, socialists agreed that the struggle against workers’ exploitation had to be international. One manifestation of the ideal, while it lasted, was the Communist University of Labourers of the East, which operated in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s. Probably its most famous alumni were Deng Xiaoping, who plugged China into global consumer capitalism, and Ho Chi Minh, who gave his name posthumously to a city that is now one of global consumer capitalism’s great foundries. After the Second World War, Perry Anderson wrote in 2002, the historical links between capital and the national, on one hand, and labour and the international, on the other, were broken. ‘Nationalism becomes predominantly a popular cause, of exploited and destitute masses, in an intercontinental revolt against Western colonialism and imperialism. Internationalism, at the same stroke, starts to change camps – assuming new forms in the ranks of capital. This was to be a fateful mutation.’

Not long ago a pair of American wind tower makers, banding together as the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, complained to the US Commerce Department that CS Wind Vietnam was dumping towers on the US market – selling them in the US for less than they sold for in Vietnam, thus unfairly harming American businesses. The coalition won its case, and the government slapped hefty tariffs on CS Wind. The circumstances of the case were odd: the US government never actually found out how much CS Wind towers cost in Vietnam, and punished the company, in the end, because it was late filing some paperwork. Why, I wondered, was it necessary to try and prove that CS Wind was dumping towers? Wasn’t it more likely the towers were fairly priced, and if CS Wind was guilty of anything it was what the French call ‘social dumping’, where products made by workers on low wages, with weak social protections, destroy jobs filled by workers on decent wages, and eat away at their communally funded health, education and welfare systems?

Dan Pickard, the coalition’s lawyer, recognised the line of thought. ‘Most of my clients who are bringing anti-dumping cases ... they’re not abandoning US production operations to chase labour around the world,’ he told me. ‘They’re in favour of fair rules for international co-operation. The majority of my clients have thought: “I’m producing in the United States, and I’m paying my guys a fair working labour rate, and I’m paying my environmental costs ... And the dumpers aren’t.” Somehow that should be factored into the analysis and I don’t think they know how and, quite frankly, I’m not sure anybody knows exactly how that should be factored in. But it strikes them as unfair.’

Hansen claimed – I’ve seen the same figures elsewhere – that labour costs make up only about 5 per cent of the cost of a wind tower, while 80 per cent comes from the cost of the raw steel, which is cheaper in Asia than in Europe. Leaving aside the issue of how much low pay and poor conditions contribute to the cost of the steel, if labour costs are such a small fraction of the price of a wind tower, why are Vietnamese workers stuck with an 84-hour week? ‘It’s their way to gain overtime, that is, earn more money,’ Hansen said. ‘You still have to see Vietnamese society as a place where everyone likes to live a little better than their neighbours and with CS Wind, they have this opportunity ... Workers are not forced to work fourteen days in a row. They accept it, due to the earnings. But today the whole habit [concerning] working hours is very much on our internal screen, as you are fully right, most accidents happen after hour ten.’ Since the deaths of workers at the Vietnam plant, he said, health and safety rules had been tightened up, and he was trying to change CS Wind’s management style. ‘We can’t allow fatal accidents at all,’ he said.

There’s an argument that social protectionism hurts workers in export industries in low-income countries like Vietnam whose fortunes are on the up. ‘You say you’re an internationalist,’ it goes. ‘You say you’re concerned about workers losing their jobs in Britain and working ridiculous hours in Vietnam, and what does it come down to? British jobs for British workers, closing markets and lost jobs for the Vietnamese.’ The trouble is that to treat the issue as one of good/bad for British workers and good/bad for Vietnamese workers is to obscure the fundamental question of whether something is good or bad for people. It is hard to find an excuse to treat stories like this one as anything other than a challenge to organised labour to go global. A world factory demands a world trade union. The cry that higher wages mean higher unemployment is the oldest scare in capital’s playbook. And if we call a global minimum wage – or a global maximum working week, or a global minimum healthcare standard – pie in the sky, we’re saying that the green energy transition is the possible, necessary utopia, and fair pay and conditions the impossible, unnecessary one.

Both journeys have a terribly long way to go. The Phu My tower workers don’t talk about climate change much, and when I asked Hien via video call about Vietnamese and British workers competing against each other within CS Wind, he said it was too big a question. ‘It never occurred to me before,’ he said, ‘that workers in the West are unemployed.’",0,0,0,0,"The comment is a detailed discussion on the complexities of international labor, trade, and economic policies, particularly in the context of wind tower production and the green energy transition.

245,"I think you've made a huge generalisation here, but ignoring that, I think the reasoning for those types of activists are:

- Humans often hold contradictory beliefs, or act against their values. The immigration thing is seen as empathetic and good for the individuals suffering, contradicting their climate change view.

- People don't think of everything. Saying it's an obvious solution only means it's obvious to you. I hadn't thought about it like that.

- You could say this about anything. There's always a more extreme step you can take if you ""truly believe in X"", and you can always claim not doing that makes you a hypocrite.

254,"I believe that there are a mix of factors taking place here. The most significant factor, and in my opinion the most reasonable, is a general lack of action over climate change. The scientific facts about climate change have been well understood since the 80s, at the latest. I think a lot of younger people feel that baby boomers just kicked the can down the road to them instead of making some hard decisions or sacrifices to slow or prevent climate change. 

The rest of the complaints I see are pretty stereotypical and less grounded in reality. I think there are some very strong criticisms of political policies that the boomer generation has enacted, but many boomers opposed those policies all along, so that's a difficult comparison to make. 

Also, I think some younger people feel that there is a good deal of hypocrisy amongst boomers with regard to things like technology. For example, you can look at the /r/boomerhumor subreddit and see lots of jokes about how young people are on their phones a lot, but I think older people have a lot of screen time as well. I don't know if that is specific to boomers, though.

For example, look up the number of hours it took at minimum wage to pay for college in the 70s, and compare that to now.

I did not claim that he was a hypocrite, that would be idiotic for all the reasons you mentioned, If you hate capitalism, and are forced into it, perhaps that’s all the more reason for (you) to hate it. 

The claim that he would raise the would raise the standard of living to that enjoyed by Europeans seems odd to my worldview, as the us has a higher (median!) standard of living... but you obviously disagree.

As for me being a trump supporter 

You are ???????, as I see no need to form an opinion that will be upset by the next racist remark of scandal in his admin. I suppose I will decide come October 2020, or when your party nominates their candidate, of which I would prefer Yang, Biden, or that mayor of south bend, Indiana.

Since you are predictability outraged that someone could have a big political disagreement with you, I will now increase your outrage by writing down random center-right thought points that I may or may not follow.

1. Gay marriage should be a right, but congress should have passed a law, instead of Kennedy doing the anti-democratic thing and causing a debate that’s probably going to be as bad as abortion. 
2. Speaking of abortion, I would advocate a schedule of no abortions after the first trimester, unless there has been rape or incest, or if the fetus is non-viable. If there has been rape or incest, I would allow abortion until 24 weeks, unless there are very special circumstances (like a molester forcibly preventing abortion access for 24 weeks). If there is a life threatening emergency for the mother, I would allow an abortion at any time. If there is a special circumstance not listed here, I would hope that congress passes a democratically crafted law that addresses these (or which contains a safe Harbor clause). 
3. I am fine with taxation of wealth above 300 million inflation adjusted at a very high rate ~70%, with a capital gains tax of 40%, but which can be lowered if the person can create jobs paying 17$ an hour and which have less than 4X your work weeks. 
4. Free contraceptives on all the corners. 
5. The creation of a program like the old CCC that will be available exclusively for the combatting of climate change, such as by working at government rates in negative carbon industries, installing carbon scrubbers, etc. 
6. Build the wall, it’s far less wasteful than a billion other programs, though the racist undertones of its supporters is regrettable (or any other suitably condemning word :), and it can serve as part of a broader legalization strategy. 
7. Create a path for the dreamers to acquire citizenship within the next 3 years, and create a free accessible program to document all 11+ million illegal aliens.
8. Make illegal immigration a felony that results immidete deportation regardless, unless a person is literally dying, in which case they will be given medical care and then deported. 
9. Create a public option, if it fails miserably, hah take that, if not, healthcare for all who want it. 
10. Add an 18 year term limit as well as ethics regulations. The regulations will be enforced by having every judge in the United States have a say on weather a Supreme Court justice should be removed or suspended for gross misconduct, if the measure passed by 3/5, it will be sent to congress to pass as a bill, and then to the president to sign the final removal or suspension order. Create a special court composed of retired Supreme Court justices and chief judges of the circuit courts to determine the validity of the law within 30 days.
11. Abolish gerrymandering
12. Stop calling the other side spawn of Satan because that’s how we got here in the first place....

12, once again, I don't care about your values, the world doesn't care about your values. Evidently your values are extremely fragile as you can't even justify them or argue its merits, and you vote in contradiction to your supposed values, which here I thought included doing something about climate change. You're basically making faith based arguments here every single time you resort to saying people should vote on values.

13, no that isn't the purpose of preferential voting.

14, you're right I shouldn't have expected anything of substance from you.

15, no I am not seeing the hypocrisy. If you can't defend your point of view, why shouldn't I dismiss them?

&gt;It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place. Many are starting to ask themselves, “What will it take for the people in power to wake up?”  
&gt;  
&gt;But let’s be clear: They are already awake. They know exactly what they are doing. They know exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to maintain business as usual. The leaders are not doing nothing; they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system. This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature and the destruction of present and future living conditions to take place.  
&gt;  
&gt;The COP has turned into a PR event where leaders are giving beautiful speeches and announcing fancy commitments and targets, while behind the curtains the governments of the Global North countries are still refusing to take any drastic climate action. It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo.  
&gt;  
&gt;And COP26 has been named the most exclusionary COP ever. This is not a conference. This is now a Global North greenwash festival, a two-week-long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah. The most affected people in the most affected areas still remain unheard, and the voices of future generations are drowning in their greenwash and empty words and promises. But the facts do not lie, and we know that our emperors are naked.  
&gt;  
&gt;To stay below the targets set in the Paris Agreement, and thereby minimizing the risks of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control, we need immediate, drastic, annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen. And as we don’t have the technological solutions that alone will do anything even close to that, that means we will have to fundamentally change our society. And this is the uncomfortable result of our leaders’ repeated failure to address this crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the current emissions rates, our remaining CO2 budgets to give us the best chances of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius will be gone within the end of this decade. And the climate and ecological crisis, of course, doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is directly tied to other crises and injustices that date back to colonialism and beyond, crises based on the idea that some people are worth more than others, and therefore had the right to steal others — to exploit others and to steal their land and resources. And it is very naive of us to think that we could solve this crisis without addressing the root cause of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not going to be spoken about inside the COP. It’s just too uncomfortable. It’s much easier for them to simply ignore the historical debt that the countries of the Global North have towards the most affected people and areas.

289,"**Why is this step necessary?**

We want to simplify our share structure. From two shares to one share. We have a clear strategy. We have a new reorganisation. We now have to go through with adapting our structure to become a faster and more agile company. We no longer want the handcuffs that impose enormous restrictions on our business below the surface. We have worked with them for years, but they have become increasingly unworkable.

**What can't you do?**

We recently sold our operations in the Permian Basin in the US (for $7bn, ed.). I want to return money to shareholders, but it's not as easy as I would like. It will take a year and a half. I'll end up getting questions from shareholders about that: ""what are you doing about it?"". And if we want to make acquisitions or sell parts, everything has to be seen through the lens of the A and B structure of our shares all the time.'

'That's getting harder and harder. As we have to go faster and take bigger steps in the energy transition, that is becoming more and more of a limiting factor. So we have to do something about that. This has nothing to do with our plans in the Netherlands. In fact, without our investment opportunities in the Netherlands, we cannot have an energy transition plan for Europe.'

**It was not possible to simplify the structure while maintaining the headquarters in the Netherlands?**

We looked at all kinds of options. We could make our shares all A-shares. but that would mean that our B-shares, 50% of the share capital, would then fall under the dividend tax of the Netherlands. Today, we no longer have the luxury of saying to shareholders ""you know what: this is easier for us, too bad for you"". We have enough problems in the sector. We cannot afford to offend shareholders.'

**A little over a year ago you said in the FD that Shell was considering moving its headquarters. Apparently the government has not succeeded in retaining you?**

We've been talking about it for sixteen years. At the time we decided that we would become a British company, but with headquarters in the Netherlands. At the time, the expectation, also expressed by the government, was that the dividend tax in the Netherlands would eventually disappear. That was problematic, because the English shares had a different dividend structure than the Dutch ones.

So for us it was clear: this is temporary. In time, the dividend tax will disappear. We have been discussing this with the government for 16 years. I have always been clear: this has to be solved, otherwise it stops.

That was yesterday. It can't be a surprise that we need this solution. The only way left if the dividend tax is not abolished, and which is guaranteed to work, is what we are proposing now.'

**To what extent does the negative sentiment against big companies and Shell in particular play a role in this decision?**

Not really. Of course I am also disappointed by the lack of national pride and the lack of recognition for what we do. If I invest a billion, it is called greenwashing. Of course that stings. But that can never be a consideration for taking such a decision. The reality is that there are three times as many people who are positive about us as negative.

**Shouldn't the Netherlands be worried about the business climate? Unilever left earlier.**

This is not a business climate issue. Otherwise we would not invest €4 billion in the Netherlands. We have also done a lot of good things together with the government, like the biofuel project in Pernis and we have worked out how to do the hydrogen project on the Maasvlakte and we are in dialogue to see if we can work in some way on the Tata Steel solution. Practically speaking, we have no problem working in the Netherlands.'

**To what extent does the court case you lost earlier this year against Milieudefensie play a role? Is Shell now avoiding the consequences of that verdict?**

Absolutely not. We have an obligation to perform. It doesn't matter where we put our tax shelter. That judgment is stuck to us and we accept that. Even if we wanted to, we wouldn't even be able to.'
