1,dq5q44r,"From cola to tomatoes, EU to embrace CO2 recycling","
ROTTERDAM, 1. NOV, 09:21
Following an industry push, the European Union seems set to explore ways to recycle CO2, through a technique called carbon capture and utilisation (CCU).
However, some warn that CCU needs to be better classified, otherwise the method can turn out to be nothing more than an accounting trick that does little to reduce emissions.

The concept of CCU is closely linked to carbon capture and storage (CCS), which has been very slow to get off the ground in the EU.
But instead of storing the CO2 molecules deep underground, as some European regions are planning to do, CCU takes those molecules and uses them as raw materials.

The concept has its supporters, like Alan Knight, general manager corporate responsibility at steel giant ArcellorMittal.

At the Companies vs Climate Change Conference in Brussels last month, Knight said he preferred CCU to CCS.

""Why store it? Why landfill carbon? I thought landfill was quite [at the] bottom on the waste hierarchy?""

The waste hierarchy is a concept from the circular economy field, which says that landfill of waste should be the ultimate option, after having tried reusing, repairing, and recycling.

He said CCU was a ""really interesting solution"", in particular when comparing it to CCS, which requires paying someone to store the CO2.

""If we can turn CO2 into something we could sell, we would be incentivised to do it,"" said Knight.

From cola to tomatoes
CCU is already applied in some sectors.

The CO2 in fizzy drinks is sometimes captured from industrial processes.

In the Netherlands, CO2 from industries operating in the port of Rotterdam is transported to the nearby Westland area, where it is used as a literal greenhouse gas, to help stimulate the growth of vegetables.

The EU is getting ready to increase its support for the development of CCU through a new Innovation Fund that will be part of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) from 2021 onwards.

The fund is the successor to the NER300 fund, which was supposed to help set up CCS projects across Europe, but failed to do so because member states did not finance their part.

Originally, the European Commission proposed that the innovation fund would be open only to CCS initiatives and ""demonstration projects of innovative renewable energy technologies.

But both the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, where member states meet, propose that CCU projects should also be eligible.

The EU institutions will meet again next Wednesday (8 November) to negotiate further on the ETS.

A spokeswoman for Estonia, which holds the six-month rotating presidency, said ""agreement is yet to be reached"" but a source in the parliament said the inclusion of CCU in the fund was ""not controversial"" and that the institutions agree.

""We are pretty sure, let's say 99.5 [percent], ... that CCS and CCU will be part of that Innovation Fund,"" EU commission official Mark van Stiphout said last Thursday (26 November) at a conference on CCS in Rotterdam.

It is not entirely clear why CCU was not originally part of the commission proposal, but its proposed inclusion has been welcomed by industrial lobby groups.

The latest compromise text on the innovation fund specified that CCU projects eligible should be ""environmentally safe"" and contribute ""substantially to mitigate climate change"".

What substantially means will have to be further defined.

""CCU is a way too wide concept. If you try to approach that with one size fits all measures from governments, then we are going to get a lot of greenwashing and bad stuff, that's for sure,"" he said.

At the Rotterdam conference, Jacek Podkanski, a senior engineer at the European Investment Bank (EIB), said the bank would finance CCU projects ""in theory"", but that each project would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

A lot depends on the life cycle of the product made with CO2, and the period during which the CO2 is kept out of the atmosphere.

If the CO2 is put in a product but then released to the atmosphere a few years later, the procedure has done little to help limit climate change.

CO2-to-fuels
One CCU application in that category that worried Helseth is using captured CO2 to make fuels.

The EU has funded research into this, through its Horizon 2020 science fund.

Steelanol, a project that tries to produce bioethanol from CO2 emitted by steel plants, received €10.2 million in 2015.

The biggest company involved in the project is ArcelorMittal. When this website asked to visit the project's site in Ghent and to receive more information, it was told to ask again at the beginning of next year.

CO2-to-fuels may also receive a boost through another piece of EU rules currently in the legislative pipeline: the renewable energy directive is currently being considered by the parliament and council.

Don't get too excited
Stuart McKay, head of CCS and hydrogen policy at the Scottish government said at the CCS conference in Rotterdam he was ""a bit concerned"" about CCU.

""What I'm worried about is that people outside this room may start to get confused and think that there is a choice between CCS or CCU. I recognise CCS as a climate mitigation tool. I don't quite recognise CCU in the same way.""

Participants of the conference also seemed to agree that while CCU could be an addition to CCS, it was not likely to be a solution that can be applied to reduce emissions in the order of magnitude needed to avert catastrophic climate disruptions.

""I would not get too excited about that,"" said the EIB's Jacek Podkanski.

David Hone, chief climate change adviser at fossil fuel giant Shell, said CCU could help reduce the price of the technology to capture CO2, which could be a stepping stone to CCS.

He too warned against seeing CCU as a silver bullet.

In Italy the Higher Institute of Health made estimates of the expected cancers, following the Chernobyl cloud. He came to an estimate of three thousand deadly tumors in a span of 40-50 years. Distributed over many decades, these are numbers that are beyond the scope of observation. More than a quarter of all causes of death are usually due to cancer, and it becomes impossible to account for a few hundred cases of cancer a year - out of a total of about 150,000.

With the basketball analogy, I completely agree. The two players have equal opportunity to dunk the ball. I'm sure there is a 5'5"" guy out there who has worked hard on his jump height, and is capable of dunking. It's a hell of a lot easier for the 7'6"" guy, but...that's how life is.

You mention how liberals/progressives want to help the 5'5"" guy, rather than hurt the 7'6"" guy, but that's not how progressive policy works in execution. Instead, progressive policies punish the 7'6"" guy, and give a cut from that to the 5'5"" guy. Or, alternatively, they move the rim up for the 7'6"" guy, or move it down for the 5'5"" guy.

I disagree with this entire philosophy. The rim is 10 feet high. If you can't dunk, and aren't willing to put in the effort necessary to be able to dunk, it isn't our job to lower the rim so you can dunk. 

Either earn it, or try something else. Not everyone is born to dunk. There is a reason why you don't see a ton of Asians or Jewish guys in the NBA, and it isn't because there is systemic inequality with a 10' rim due to different racial backgrounds having different average heights. Likewise, the reason why you don't see a ton of Changs or Nakamuras playing wide receiver isn't because football is unfair. Asians have equal opportunity to throw on pads and catch footballs. They just have a much more difficult path to making the cut. That doesn't mean we need to impose a maximum total inches in height cap on teams to try and lower the bar so that it's easier for short people to make the NFL. It just means that if you're a 5'3"" Chinese dude who wants to be a star wideout, you're going to have to make sure you never drop a single ball, and that you're the fastest dude in the field. 

I think the difference here is when I say equal opportunity, I don't mean that every single person has the exact same statistical odds of success. That is unrealistic. Even if we had a ""The Giver"" society where there were no parents, no property, total wealth equity, and absolutely no material differences in wealth or resources from person to person, people would still have different odds of success based on genetic traits. Someone who is the child of 2 olympians will have a far better chance of also being a superstar athlete than someone who is the child of two obese, diabetic, and heart diseased individuals. When I say equality of opportunity, I mean that the avenues are available to you. Every single person should be able to apply to college. You shouldn't be barred from even applying based on class, race, or religion. Every person should be allowed to start a business. We shouldn't ban certain groups from ownership of property, or from investing. Every person should be able to make it into the NHL, if they prove they have the ability. We shouldn't have ""must be 6' to enter"" rules for athletes. Every person should be allowed equal opportunity to succeed, in that the opportunity should be made available to all, regardless of who their parents are, where they are from, how much they make, what their job is, or what their education level is.

I think what you're talking about is equality in the level of difficulty in taking advantage of opportunity. That's just not realistic, in my view, and it damages the efficiency of everything it touches. There is a reason why you don't see short guys in the NBA, or women playing at linebacker. It isn't because the system of professional sports is unfair or discriminatory. If a short guy can shoot 95% from anywhere on the court, he will certainly find a spot on an NBA roster. If a woman can consistently make key stops in the open field, stuff the gap, and read plays, she will find a spot on an NFL roster. It's just that the difficulty in doing these things are incredibly high. It doesn't mean we need to change the sport. It means that short guys or NFL-hopeful women need to either be prepared to work harder than anyone else, or that they need to redirect their efforts and create more efficient goals.

As for the car example, I was showing how private consumers responded to a well-known environmental scandal. You say the scandal was from them breaking government rules. While that's partially true, the real scandal for the average consumer was that VW was producing extremely polluting vehicles. Even people who don't agree with climate change theory (or people who think it's exaggerated) were put off by VW's cars deliberately putting out genuine pollutants that cause acid rain and smog. The stock may have crashed due to fear of massive civil and criminal penalties against the corporation (even then, I would argue that a big part of the crash was due to anticipation of sales tanking, which has nothing to do with the government), but the sales crashed because individual consumers lost their trust in VW as a company. People didn't think to themselves, ""man, I really want a Jetta, but VW is going to get seriously fined by the EPA and they violated a battery of U.S. and EU laws, so I guess I'll settle for a Camry."" They made a personal decision to not financially support a company that lied to its consumers, because they were disgusted with the blatant and intentional deception. Even if the government issued no penalties, and if no law existed regarding emissions, the scandal would've still come out. It was a group of student researchers that uncovered the whole thing, not government investigators. VW successfully duped the government the whole time. It took independent inspectors that were making a paper on the accuracy of advertising (IIRC) to find the defeat device. I don't see why the consumer that decided to stop buying VW cars would've not done so in the absence of government regulation. They would've done the exact same thing: refuse to give money to a company that blatantly lied about its product. ",0,,

14,hsrnpec,“A Huge Mistake.” The E.U. Jeopardizes its Climate Goals By Labeling Natural Gas as Green,"# “A Huge Mistake.” The E.U. Jeopardizes its Climate Goals By Labeling Natural Gas as Green

By *Ciara Nugent*

A long-simmering debate about the future of natural gas has been forced to a head in Europe this month, as the E.U. considers classifying some projects involving the fossil fuel as sustainable investments in official advice for the private sector due to be published by the end of January.


Burning natural gas produces carbon dioxide—but around 50% less than burning coal. The E.U. gets 22% of its energy from natural gas, and to meet its ambitious climate targets, the European Commission says it needs to cut use of the fuel by 37% by 2030. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, says the world needs to stop all investment in new gas and oil projects from 2021 onwards in order to keep on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050.


So it surprised many when, on Dec. 31, a draft version of the E.U.’s green energy taxonomy—a long-awaited list of investments the bloc considers sustainable for the planet—said that natural gas projects should count as green under certain conditions. (Nuclear energy, which does not emit greenhouse gases but carries other environmental risks, also got a controversial inclusion).


On. Jan 12, a coalition of influential investors including BlackRock, Vanguard and most of the world’s largest asset managers sent an open letter to E.U. representatives urging them to rethink the inclusion of natural gas in the taxonomy. “It is our view that the proposals in the [draft] would seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance, potentially triggering a ‘race to the bottom’,” the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change wrote, “which could dilute the level of climate ambition within emerging jurisdictional taxonomies.”


With the private sector trying to overhaul its spending to meet a deluge of environmental pledges made in recent years, the goal of the taxonomy is to guide money to the right places and hasten the energy transition.


The taxonomy, a technical document, has become a political battleground for warring visions between member states over the future of natural gas. One side—including many Central and Eastern European countries and Italy—argues that Europe needs to invest more in natural gas as a “bridge fuel” from even-dirtier coal and oil to a fully clean energy future. The other side—including Sweden, Austria, Spain, Ireland and others—says that the E.U. needs to discourage investment in all fossil fuels including gas inside its borders, and instead channel every available resource into ramping up renewables, which make up only around 17% of Europe’s energy supply.


The debate has divided the E.U.’s two largest economies. Germany’s government, a coalition including the Green party, has said the draft taxonomy amounts to “greenwashing,” while France has backed it, largely because it includes nuclear energy, the country’s main energy source.


The draft text has sparked fierce backlash from environmentalists across the bloc, who warn that the E.U.’s green credentials for gas—even with conditions attached—will have implications far beyond the natural gas market in Europe, confusing investors around the world and providing cover for the fossil fuel industry in developing countries.


”As a bloc, we are losing a lot of the legitimacy we need to convince others to shift their policies in order to achieve climate sustainability,” says Mounir Satouri, a Green member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France. “This is a huge mistake.”


## The case for natural gas as a transitional fuel

Wind and solar power are becoming very cheap to install, but we still lack some of the technology to store their energy for longer periods when the wind isn’t blowing or sun isn’t shining. Advocates for natural gas argue that it’s easy to store, and power plants running on the fuel can be turned off and on as needed, making it a great complement to renewables for the next decade or so.


The E.U.’s taxonomy labels natural gas as a “transitional fuel,” and investments in it will count as green if power plants produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour and are equipped to burn lower carbon gases, such as green hydrogen. Any new natural gas project must also replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31, 2030.


The green label “will certainly unlock some investment. But that will be very focalized in those markets where there’s still quite a lot of reliance on coal: in central and eastern Europe and perhaps Germany,” says Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of global gas research at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.


The E.U. aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 in order to stay on track to avoid the worst of climate change. Classing some natural gas as green is a pragmatic decision to help coal-reliant member states shift off coal more quickly and meet that target, according to Christian Ehler, a German MEP from the center-right European People’s Party. “Poland is not jumping from coal to wind [turbines]—there will be a step in between. So politically there needs to be a compromise,” he says. “If a national energy mix includes gas in order to fulfill the 55% ambitions, why should that harm either the environment or the commonly formulated goals? I think this politics of symbolism has to come to an end if you really want to reach those goals.”


## Muddying the green waters

But environmentalists reject the idea that natural gas is needed as a bridge fuel. “This transitional mentality arguing in favor of ‘less bad’ energy forces could have worked a couple of decades ago,” says Jakop Dalunde, a Green MEP from Sweden. “But today, in a climate emergency, we have to have full focus on energy sources that are truly sustainable.”


Granting natural gas a “green stamp,” he adds, could divert money from investments in clean energy—a problem, given renewables capacity needs to expand by 12% ever year to stay on track for net zero at 2050, per the IEA. “This [taxonomy] is about the long-term future we want to encourage. Fossil fuels have no place there.”


Though the taxonomy includes fairly stringent conditions for natural-gas projects to be classed as green, campaigners are concerned that it will be difficult to hold projects accountable for meeting them, says Tsvetelina Kuzmanova, a sustainable finance policy advisor at European climate think tank E3G. For example, power plants would need to switch to 100% low-carbon gases by 2035 under the rules, but the technology does not yet exist to run a gas power plant only with low carbon gases, so it is unclear how a gas project seeking green funding in the present would prove it can eventually do that.


Kuzmanova says that any expansion of natural gas poses a threat to the E.U.’s short-term goal on methane—a potent greenhouse gas with 80 times the warming power of CO2—which is the main component of natural gas. At COP26, the U.N. climate conference last November, the E.U. pledged to cut its methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Leaks from natural gas infrastructure are one major source of methane emissions, while the rest mostly come from agriculture. “Reducing natural gas infrastructure really should be the low-hanging fruit on methane,” Kuzmanova says.


## The impact beyond Europe

Climate campaigners also worry about the wider signal that the move sends on the urgency of phasing out gas. The E.U. has presented itself as a climate leader for the world in recent years, says Marie Toussaint, a Green MEP from France. “If we then say natural gas can be a sustainable investment, the message that other countries get is that it’s still okay to keep producing gas for many years,” she says, adding that other governments may follow the E.U.’s example but fail to impose the same limiting conditions on gas investments.


Analysts say policy makers in South Korea followed the E.U.’s discussion closely when drafting their own sustainable energy taxonomy, published in December, which also classifies natural gas as a transitional fuel.


And, though the taxonomy is meant only as advice to the private sector, Toussaint says she sees its influence in other E.U. legislation that lawmakers are reviewing as part of the European Green Deal. The European Investment Bank also aligns its lending with the taxonomy.


For Dalunde, the Swedish MEP, a taxonomy that includes natural gas is a wasted opportunity to deliver the level of climate ambition the world urgently needs. “This taxonomy had the potential to be one of the most consequential decisions that we take on climate change, not only for Europe, but globally, because other nations will take inspiration from it,” says Dalunde. “It could have been a quiet revolution. But the inclusion of fossil gas would really undermine that.”",0,,

From this [article](https://georgelakoff.com/2016/11/22/a-minority-president-why-the-polls-failed-and-what-the-majority-can-do/):

&gt;In politics, institutions, and cultural life, words tend not to be neutral. Instead their meanings are defined with respect to political world-views. There are conservative and liberal vocabularies. “Save the planet!” is liberal. “Energy independence” is a conservative ‘dog whistle.’ It means dig coal and drill for oil and gas, even on public lands, and don’t invest seriously in solar and wind. Some might think those are politically neutral expressions. If you take them literally and ignore worldview differences, you might think everyone should want to save the planet and everyone should want energy independence. Liberals want literal energy independence, but through sustainable energy like solar and wind. Conservatives don’t believe in man-made climate change and want energy independence through maximizing coal, gas, and oil. Politically charged meanings put the other side in a bind. The opposition cannot answer directly. You won’t hear conservatives say “I don’t want to save the planet,” nor liberals say, “I’m against energy independence.” Instead they have to change the frame.  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, negating a frame just activates the frame and makes it stronger. I wrote a book called “Don’t Think of an Elephant!” to make that point. Liberals are often caught in this trap. If a conservative says, “we should have tax relief,” she is using the metaphor that taxation is an affliction that we need relief from. If a liberal replies, “No, we don’t need tax relief,” she is accepting the idea that taxation is an affliction. The first thing that is, or should be, taught about political language is not to repeat the language of the other side or negate their framing of the issue.

&gt;Some high religious fundamentalists turn up in all the faiths represented in my samples, including Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. Within Christianity, I always find some Catholics scoring highly on the Religious Fundamentalism scale, a few Anglicans post big numbers, some Lutherans ring the bell, and so on. But in study after study the high scores pile up far more often in the conservative Protestant denominations than anywhere else, among Baptists, Mennonites, Pentecostals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Alliance Church, and so on. It bears repeating that this is a generalization, and some Baptists, etcetera score quite low in fundamentalism. But if you want to make a safe wager, see what odds you can get betting that these conservative sects will score higher on the Religious Fundamentalism scale than the other major Christian groups.

&gt;This chapter has presented my main research findings on religious fundamentalists. The first thing I want to emphasize, in light of the rest of this book, is that they are highly likely to be authoritarian followers. They are highly submissive to established authority, aggressive in the name of that authority, and conventional to the point of insisting everyone should behave as their authorities decide. They are fearful and self-righteous and have a lot of hostility in them that they readily direct toward various out-groups. They are easily incited, easily led, rather un-inclined to think for themselves, largely impervious to facts and reason, and rely instead on social support to maintain their beliefs. They bring strong loyalty to their in-groups, have thick-walled, highly compartmentalized minds, use a lot of double standards in their judgments, are surprisingly unprincipled at times, and are often hypocrites.  
&gt;  
&gt;But they are also Teflon-coated when it comes to guilt. They are blind to themselves, ethnocentric and prejudiced, and as closed-minded as they are narrow-minded. They can be woefully uninformed about things they oppose, but they prefer ignorance and want to make others become as ignorant as they. They are also surprisingly uninformed about the things they say they believe in, and deep, deep, deep down inside many of them have secret doubts about their core belief. But they are very happy, highly giving, and quite zealous. In fact, they are about the only zealous people around nowadays in North America, which explains a lot of their success in their endless (and necessary) pursuit of converts.

(page 143)

&gt;Fundamentalists have been successful, to some extent, at appropriating the label “religious” for only themselves, just as some political conservatives have unfairly pilfered “patriot.” Many fundamentalists claim that if one does not believe what they believe and act as they say you should, one is not really religious (e.g. “not a true Christian”). This chapter is about religious fundamentalists, and I do not wish to imply that all religious people are fundamentalists. Most persons in my sample who consider themselves affiliated with an organized religion do not score highly on the Religious Fundamentalism scale, and there are many ways of being religious without even belonging to a religion.",0,,

You might be right. But the baby boomers in political power sure demonstrate these traits as well.

&gt; The climate change issue is the same, actually. Sure the ""younger generations"" protest more about it, but are they actually doing anything about it? Protesting is nice, its like a party really. And you have someone else to blame - again, for everything, including the fault of why those protesting parties dont work.

I agree, we aren't really doing anything that's helping. But we are trying despite general exhaustion with the state of the world (and draconian restrictions put in place by those in power. In Australia, there are laws that restrict protests).

Are baby boomers doing anything? Did I miss something?

&gt; I wonder how much of the environment feels any of you would have when actual restrictive measures would be taken and so reductions of life style. Besides, are we talking about western relatively rich and well positioned younger generations or the whole world? 

Lots of younger people, including myself, are adopting a life of minimalism and would prefer say, living in a repurposed shipping container over owning a mansion.

&gt; If we are talking about US - well, younger generation there just had the rare opportunity to elect a truly progressive and just candidate which would surely beat Trump in next elections and they have totally failed to even fucking vote. But complaining on the internet about it? Mmm-mm. From the fucking couch. 

I'm in Australia, but am following the US situation. I am appalled that Bernie is not SMASHING the polls. I blame the established Deep State for keeping someone like Biden in the running, in conjunction with the mainstream media's clearly biased coverage. Are you also forgetting the fact that older generations get to vote too?

Bless Eric and the rest of the pirate radio movement for trying. Oh yeah - that seems to me like a damn good effort on the side of Millenials in answering your previous question (see Red Scare podcast, FriendlyJordies (Australian political commentator), and more).

&gt; On the whole though, i dont think you can make any relevant judgement or evaluations of personality traits and qualities based on such generalizations. The real differences are in individuals, and always have been.

Sure - whatever you want to believe. I'm just trying to push this conversation forward without doing what you're doing: ""Yeah you guys aren't doing anything either, so shut up and just let the world continue to go to shit"". Bad argument imo with no evidence, anecdotal or reliable.

This is just my perspective from the front lines as a frustrated but hopeful Millenial. I do think you are right here to a large extent (being that things are largely individual). But younger generations are learning at an exponential rate how to be moral and contribute to society (thanks to technology and people like Eric, Joe Rogan, etc. [And please don't argue that Rogan is detrimental to society as some kind of alt. right figure - man's an international treasure]). I consider myself to be one of these Millenials.

But for that people would need to understand the German Grid and Electricity supply.

Lignite is the issue and those Regions never had a running nuclear reactor. Nor Powerlines. 

Also Germany is missing the massive Hydro, Sweden and France have. That helps with either high share of Nuclear or Renewables and stay low carbon. Or just as another big low Carbon Electricity source.

The biggest issue is we have a government that had shit energy policy on Federal, but also on State level. Yes our State do also have a say in Energy policies. 

Even when CDU/CSU and FDP backed Nuclear, no new construction. Plants were already beginning to close on their own. The political Will was not there. Renewables are political far more realistics.

In my opinion also the finanically more viable and the faster one to Scale. Even if would achieve Asian building timeframe, which often were also over time. Looking at France it doesn't seems so.

&#x200B;

The issue is of course NIMBYism. Let's take Bavaria: The most restricitve distance rules for Windpower(far higher than for any other source of Energy). While Onshore Windpower being the cheapest Renewable soruce and the backbone of German Renewables.

Bavaria is the State that had the longest resistance against the North-South Powerlines as they will probably need Electricity from the North, especially Wind.

Only when the Commision threaten to cut the German Energy market in two the resistance from State level politics completly crumbled.

And even though they also use Nuclear power, they declared that would never accept the Nuclear waste storage in their State.

&#x200B;

How do you work with that?

&#x200B;

If you look in Germany for Region you will see a Pattern. North-West Renewables sucessfully replaced Hard-Coal and Nuclear. North-East, Central East Renewables sucessfully replaced Lignite.

Central Germany(NRW and Saxony), slow Renewable building and rate and failed to replace lignite in larger numbers. 

Central Germany non-lignite a big mix of different State, but neither Nuclear nor Coal play a big role, except Saarland with Hardcoal  as a former Mining State.

South Germany weird Energy policies and NIMBYism, but also not much Coal.

As part of the European Green Deal and Mobility Data Space, this approach can be formulised and mainstreamed.

A recent example is the European Green Digital Coalition, that already houses mobility service providers. Another one is the creation of the Battery Passport, which has been enshrined in the Battery Regulation draft and will be required for all vehicle batteries coming into service starting 2026.

I 100% agree with you that Trump is a fascist and is a Russian plant, that his administration has had involvement with Russia. That's undisputed at this point, and what he's done to the EPA is nothing short of obscene.

If Trump knew the pandemic was dangerous but did nothing, and committed politicized, he is beyond evil and a mass murderer (something I've already concluded months ago-- for fuck's sake if I was still Catholic I would have called him the literal Antichrist, and yet he's led astray so many supposed ""Christians"").

The whole thing about the right's rage over Obama is idiotic, and I agree. So many people still (falsely) believe that Obama is Muslim, or that he wasn't born in the US, or that he's a thousand other unsubstantiated things. Many Republicans hate and speak badly of Obama likely just because he's black, and I have family who somehow believe Obama is a Communist when there is zero evidence this is the case, and deny climate change, and say racial slurs.

&gt;For one you can look at the criminal records of all Republican leadership and you will find that they have committed crimes, especially sex crimes with underage children, at more then 4 times(4 times!) The rate that democrat leadership has. If you've never looked at this before you will be absolutely shocked: dozens and dozens and dozens of Republicans in power right now from mayors to governors to congressman have been convicted of raping and molesting and even trafficking children. This is factually not true about the Democrat side of the aisle.

I had no idea so many Republicans were literally child molesters, but I need to see some sources to back up this particular claim, because I can't just take your word without *reputable, unbiased, or minimally biased* sources. It's obvious nowadays that so many Catholic priests or clergy are child molesters, and it's truly sickening that the Vatican/the Church had these priests transferred to other parishes for decades, and not arrested for their crimes. Rather than admit the truth, they chose to hide pure evil under the rug. So much for preaching goodness and holiness. A lot of Hollywood directors, actors, and powerful people are also child molesters or rapists-- and many of them are liberal or lean liberal. But with Republican politicians I draw a blank-- I'm not well versed in the sheer number of pedophile Republicans you claim exist. The only connection I can make is Epstein, because he had connections with many politicians and powerful people on both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump, the Clintons, etc.

If you are correct and can prove your assertions, it's ironic that so many far-right loonies accuse Democrats of leading a pedophile ring (PizzaGate, QAnon, etc), when they themselves are the pedos. It's a classic case of projection.

Edit: I've checked on some sites and some people say that there are just as many Democrat child molesters as Republicans, and mention Jared Fogle and other liberals who also molested kids, but I have had trouble finding a definitive list of Democrats guilty of child abuse. Even if there are 4 times as many Republicans who are guilty of child molestation in comparison to Democrats, as you assert, this shouldn't minimize the guilt and culpability of Democrats who are also culpable of the same crimes, even if incidences of sexual crimes among Dems is comparatively less common or smaller.

Pedophilia exists on all sides of the political spectrum and (should) be considered a non-partisan issue. I think what makes Republicans worse off in this regard is their hypocrisy and excessive religiosity-- they preach moral family values and to follow Jesus but then do horrible things when no one's looking. So not only are Republican pedos disgusting, but they're also liars and hypocrites.

I don't know. I'm open to your thoughts. That list of Republicans is horrifying.

To compare, Bill Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky, sure, but at least she was of legal age, and (supposedly) it was consensual, yet many on the right who accused him of immorality themselves were having affairs with other women or men.

Or 2. Albums and photobooks don't have as much negative impacts as fossil fuel, deforestation or carbon omission. Go after the ones that have the big impact. Well, NFTs are lot worse for the environment than photobooks. But now we can't fight NFTs either because your fave suddenly support NFTs?

51,d5368ld,,"You're simplifying an issue into sound bites.

&gt;climate change

Firstly, the TPP includes more stringent environmental protections and standards. But this is a trade agreement for which all members already agreed to the COP Paris climate change agreement. I'm not sure where your issue is here.

&gt;The investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows foreign corporations bypass U.S. law

I hate this argument!!!! ISDS doesn't allow corporations to challenge laws they disagree with. It gives corporations the power to stop countries from violating the free trade agreements. Without an enforcement mechanism, we can't have free trade.

For example, in the 1990's Canada banned the import of a harmful gasoline additive called MMT. The ban was challenged by an American company and was successful. The reason for the challenge was not the ban on the chemical, it was challenged because Canadian companies were allowed to keep selling it while Mexican and American companies could not. This violated NAFTA, and without provisions like ISDS, there is no way to challenge unfair treatment. Without it, there is no point in having a FTA. 

&gt;Does not require all countries to be in full compliance with international labor standards

What it does is enforce higher labor standards than currently exist in developing countries. We give them an incentive to improve. I'm sorry, but you can't expect developing countries to have the same standards as the developed. By making this a condition, you are effectively hindering their economic opportunity. Access to the American Market, economic growth and increased wealth are the best way to improve labor standards and living standards. By asking for first world standards, you are effectively banning them from competing, making the poor poorer, and doing nothing to improve the situation. 

&gt;Does not protect from foreign state-owned and state-subsidized companies and their predatory tactics

Yes it does. Not sure where you got this info. Countries can block predatory behavior which will hold up in any ISDS dispute as a result; so long as there is evidence.

&gt;TPP overrules any ""Buy American"" 

You can't have both protectionism and trade liberalization. This isn't hard to understand. 

&gt;New monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies

Those are actually being forced on Americas allies. America already has the same rules for domestic pharmaceuticals. A lot of TPP partners aren't happy about it but it is a provision that benefits America greatly. 

&gt;TPP has some of the same language as PROTECT IP Act and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) that are held up in Congress. 

This is a myth that has been debunked many times already.

I am so done with all the left-wing hysteria on Free Trade. Left wing protectionists are the biggest hypocrites on the planet. For all the talk about inequality, they would support policies that take from the 90% and give it to the 10%. Free trade and globalization have done a huge amount to improve living, health, and labor standards. On a global scale, it is a great equalizer. 

Fucking spare me the bullshit.

52,exlbz5v,,"I attended the grassroots event last night in Chicago and I have some thoughts regarding my experience and ways we as a community can encourage and facilitate a more inclusive and diverse base.

First, this was my first Pete-related event and he was quite impressive, as I had expected. The stump speech was more compelling than I had heard in the past; as though he's finding the right language and delivering it with more passion. He hit on the Three Values (Freedom, Security, and Democracy) and delivered the context around why they're important, drive policy, and inform leadership. I also liked how he folded the Douglass Plan, Rural Economy and Health Plans, and Gun Violence Action Plan into the stump speech.

The Q&amp;A was impressive as well, the questions were poignant, their owners were bold and courageous, and Pete's answers were nuanced, direct, and intimate. I'll give a few examples here:

* There was a question from a trans member of the military--whom will be unable to re-enlist given the anti-trans policies of this administration--that centered around how a Pete admin would improve the trans experience and tear down barriers to opportunity. Prior to digging into the answer however, Pete had the audience stand and applaud/thank the questioner for their service and courage; which was heart-warming and inspiring to say the least. If I remember correctly, Pete's answer centered around the passage of the Equality Act, expansion of trans medical services within the military, and that his admin would support and advocate for trans rights.
* A newly minted high school student lamented about how he had to worry about what to do in the event of an active shooter situation, and further asked what Pete would do the allay that fear. At this point, there was a collective 'Oh no' from the crowd, signaling a disappointment that we adults have failed to deliver a safe learning environment for this young adult. Pete responded with that sentiment directly, suggesting that it is a failure of 'the adults' for not delivering solutions that would allow this student to worry about high school, and not whether they will make it home that day. He discussed the failures of the current democratic system for not providing solutions to gun violence that have broad bi-partisan support, suggested ways that system can be adjusted to provide citizens a richer voice in the decision making process of the government (end gerrymandering, reform campaign finance, implement the popular vote, etc.), and further discussed elements from the Gun Violence Action Plan that would be implemented in a Pete admin, but really stressed the Political and Civic action elements that Americans can execute now.
* A twelve year old (maybe ten?) asked about climate change and what we can do to address it. Again, the crowd lamented that we had failed yet another child. Similar to the gun violence question, Pete addressed the failures of adults in delivering meaningful solutions to address the threat of climate change. That this child should be occupied with 12-year old interests, such as twelve year old Pete's interest in space exploration (as a space nerd, I'm heartened to know that Pete was enamored with it as well). Pete went on to suggest his ideas on the Carbon Tax and Dividend, stronger investment in renewable energy generation and storage technologies, re-signing the Paris Climate Accord and starting the community-focused variant within the U.S., and supporting the development of carbon capture technologies for use with sustainable farming practices. One of the most powerful elements of his response, I thought, was the end when he thanked the child for their boldness and explained that the easiest way to get the attention of a politician is to have a child boldly ask hard questions and encouraged her to continue holding himself and other leaders to account for their actions.

Overall, I left impressed, inspired, and excited to support Pete and his campaign.

The second point that I would like to address is the lack of black and brown representation in the crowd, despite being in Bronzeville (a majority black neighborhood on the south side of Chicago). I have seen threads here, threads on twitter, and my peers talk about the disparity and its broader implications. Part of the issue resides in name recognition, community attentiveness to politics, and convenience, but I think this particular event provides an opportunity for our community to learn how to support black and brown voices in the political process, make space for their presence at townhall/grassroot/rally events (especially in a majority-minority communities), and invite them to be involved in and shape this candidacy. As a white person from the north side of the city, I recognize that my being at this event occupied space that could have (and likely should have) been filled by a member of the Bronzeville community. I think the format of the event itself and the opaqueness of the marketing (and potentially lack there-of) contribute to this lack of representation. First, the cost of a ticket presents an immediate barrier for someone to attend, especially once the cheaper levels are sold out. If marketing is not strong and members of the community are unable to purchase tickets in advance, their ability to attend is hindered, which leads to my second observation: marketing and outreach. Prior to purchasing the ticket, I was unaware of the location of the event. It would not have deterred me from attending, but it certainly would have made me think twice about occupying space. More broadly though, it seems that these types of events are not well publicized (despite the event space being at capacity) and a thread from a family who lived in a building next door suggests that they were unaware of the event in the first place.

As supporters of Pete however, I think we can be of service in addressing these issues. The first is by way of encouraging the campaign to make changes to the format/outreach/marketing and so forth and by having conversations 'on the ground' with our friends, family, and broader community (esp those of color), and invite them to the proverbial table. We could accomplish the first by suggesting potential solutions (to the campaign) that make these events more convenient and compelling to a diverse crowd and to the members of the hosting community. These solutions may include a set of subsidized (free) tickets that could be disseminated among the host community by community leaders (such as Rev. Chris Harris whom Pete met with some weeks back to discuss his concerns within the Bronzeville community), a broader outreach effort to reach more members of the community and invite them to attend, and a more transparent and accessible marketing effort for the events such that location and time are easily available to those interested in attending. (My guess is that the location is withheld until purchase because of security concerns?) The second element of 'on the ground' efforts is fairly straight forward. Talking to people you know in your community, in your friend groups, and so forth about Pete and how they could be part of the campaign and shape it too. Much to Rev. Harris' chagrin, the crowd last night needed more black and brown representation and he suggested inviting our black and brown friends and family to a future event (or expanding our social circles in case none are included).

Now, I recognize that this event has a dual purpose of fundraising and Pete Outreach. Providing free tickets to members of a community may not be viable at scale for this type of event, but rather it suggests that the campaign may need to hold more free events, like townhalls, rallies, or meet and greets. We know that Pete is putting in the work to understand the issues of Black and Brown Americans; meeting them where they are, empathizing as best he can with their concerns, and diligently seeking to address those concerns with solutions that can work at scale (a la Douglass Plan). I think we as a community can contribute mightily in bringing more people to the campaign, whether by our own efforts or by encouraging the campaign to operate a little differently, and give Pete a hand in his effort to usher in a new era for the country.

These of course are my own thoughts. I would love to hear from those of you reading, what can the community do or suggest to the campaign that would help welcome diverse communities and concerns into the fold? What are ways non-POC members of the community can make space for POC members? What are your own observations of representation issue?",,,

Some gems:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The glaring inconsistency between Klarman’s sermonizing and his firm’s behav­ior—and the extent to which it goes unnoticed, seemingly even by Klarman himself—illuminates the depths of American elites’ self-delusion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Harvard’s president is correct to note that Seth Klarman epitomizes what Harvard Business School has to offer us today. He is wrong to celebrate this fact. Klarman’s prominence conveys that incongruence between words and actions is tolerable, even desired. Holding him up as a role model encourages our best and brightest to pursue value cap­ture, not value creation—no matter the impact on people in the real economy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Klarman’s message that evening at HBS was not an exhortation to reform a flawed system but a warning to established and aspiring business elites alike that they face further scrutiny in the months and years ahead. His career tells us how he would advise those beginning their careers to navigate these challenges: Loudly criticize political dysfunction, but make no effort to explore its structural causes or remedies. Decry political inertia on climate change, but keep your powder dry because it will present excellent investment opportunities. Say the easy things about prioritizing your employees, but never forget that your shareholders come first. Speak of investing as an activity that requires a long-term view, but never miss an oppor­tunity for short-term arbitrage. Stand up for democratic norms, un­less, of course, electoral outcomes threaten your returns. When that happens, patiently explain how the market works, and if there is still conflict, use your network, education, and checkbook to cut to the front of the line.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At bottom, when many of our country’s wealthy citizens say “democracy,” what they really mean is “our class’s way of life.” If they respected democracy as fervently as they worship the “invisible hand,” they would see that the popular discontent simmering across the world today is the direct result of decades of elite hypocrisy and greed, hidden behind a façade of neoliberal economics. But rather than consider the structural economic reforms that will be required to actually address the causes of populism, they obfuscate with moralistic rhetoric about democratic norms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Beyond politics, Klarman is also symbolic of a larger tragedy: his career epitomizes a colossal misallocation of human capital. For decades, increasingly large numbers of America’s smartest and hard­est-working businesspeople have toiled in extractive pursuits, and the result is an economy that benefits an increasingly smaller per­centage of its participants.",,,
56,i5x4cry,,"I mean the majority of what you said is just plainly not what leftists do. Liberals != Leftist. I personally don't know any irl leftists that even know what Funko pops are, and leftist media people seem to universally use Funko pops to make fun of liberals for literally the same reason you are rn. Your argument about Tesla is just dumb, being a leftist doesn't mean the society we live in is leftist so it's not hypocritical to participate in it because you have to in order to exist, buying a Tesla is simply the pragmatic choice when it comes to long term cost and effect on the environment. It doesn't mean you can't criticize the CEO or believe his level of wealth is inherently dangerous to society. I would still argue that the majority of Tesla owners who you consider leftists, again simply aren't leftists and are in fact liberal too. I and again most leftists would also argue that the focus on plastic straws was a farce from the beggining entirely built around giving liberals something to feel good about so they can continue ignoring the actual problems with climate change and the actual reality of what they need to sacrifice to make meaningful change. The same can be said about March on wallstreet, although I will give you that it was a failure on alot of the leftist organizers for not planning ahead or educating the majority of the movement about what they're there to accomplish. No one has a parasocial relationship with Wendy's except maybe liberals, completely just a straw man ascribing that to leftists. Same with celebrities, the only pro celebrities being paid alot argument from the left would be that their wealth comes without exploitation or at least no where near the level someone with similar wealth would commit while being a business owner, again though it's just not something the left cares about. We probably do look down on uneducated conservatives too much, that is absolutely a fault of a lot of people on the left. 

Maybe you should learn the difference between leftists and liberals, because we hate liberals just as much as you do and for the same exact reasons.",,,

Long ago, socialists agreed that the struggle against workers’ exploitation had to be international. One manifestation of the ideal, while it lasted, was the Communist University of Labourers of the East, which operated in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s. Probably its most famous alumni were Deng Xiaoping, who plugged China into global consumer capitalism, and Ho Chi Minh, who gave his name posthumously to a city that is now one of global consumer capitalism’s great foundries. After the Second World War, Perry Anderson wrote in 2002, the historical links between capital and the national, on one hand, and labour and the international, on the other, were broken. ‘Nationalism becomes predominantly a popular cause, of exploited and destitute masses, in an intercontinental revolt against Western colonialism and imperialism. Internationalism, at the same stroke, starts to change camps – assuming new forms in the ranks of capital. This was to be a fateful mutation.’

Not long ago a pair of American wind tower makers, banding together as the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, complained to the US Commerce Department that CS Wind Vietnam was dumping towers on the US market – selling them in the US for less than they sold for in Vietnam, thus unfairly harming American businesses. The coalition won its case, and the government slapped hefty tariffs on CS Wind. The circumstances of the case were odd: the US government never actually found out how much CS Wind towers cost in Vietnam, and punished the company, in the end, because it was late filing some paperwork. Why, I wondered, was it necessary to try and prove that CS Wind was dumping towers? Wasn’t it more likely the towers were fairly priced, and if CS Wind was guilty of anything it was what the French call ‘social dumping’, where products made by workers on low wages, with weak social protections, destroy jobs filled by workers on decent wages, and eat away at their communally funded health, education and welfare systems?

Dan Pickard, the coalition’s lawyer, recognised the line of thought. ‘Most of my clients who are bringing anti-dumping cases ... they’re not abandoning US production operations to chase labour around the world,’ he told me. ‘They’re in favour of fair rules for international co-operation. The majority of my clients have thought: “I’m producing in the United States, and I’m paying my guys a fair working labour rate, and I’m paying my environmental costs ... And the dumpers aren’t.” Somehow that should be factored into the analysis and I don’t think they know how and, quite frankly, I’m not sure anybody knows exactly how that should be factored in. But it strikes them as unfair.’

Hansen claimed – I’ve seen the same figures elsewhere – that labour costs make up only about 5 per cent of the cost of a wind tower, while 80 per cent comes from the cost of the raw steel, which is cheaper in Asia than in Europe. Leaving aside the issue of how much low pay and poor conditions contribute to the cost of the steel, if labour costs are such a small fraction of the price of a wind tower, why are Vietnamese workers stuck with an 84-hour week? ‘It’s their way to gain overtime, that is, earn more money,’ Hansen said. ‘You still have to see Vietnamese society as a place where everyone likes to live a little better than their neighbours and with CS Wind, they have this opportunity ... Workers are not forced to work fourteen days in a row. They accept it, due to the earnings. But today the whole habit [concerning] working hours is very much on our internal screen, as you are fully right, most accidents happen after hour ten.’ Since the deaths of workers at the Vietnam plant, he said, health and safety rules had been tightened up, and he was trying to change CS Wind’s management style. ‘We can’t allow fatal accidents at all,’ he said.

There’s an argument that social protectionism hurts workers in export industries in low-income countries like Vietnam whose fortunes are on the up. ‘You say you’re an internationalist,’ it goes. ‘You say you’re concerned about workers losing their jobs in Britain and working ridiculous hours in Vietnam, and what does it come down to? British jobs for British workers, closing markets and lost jobs for the Vietnamese.’ The trouble is that to treat the issue as one of good/bad for British workers and good/bad for Vietnamese workers is to obscure the fundamental question of whether something is good or bad for people. It is hard to find an excuse to treat stories like this one as anything other than a challenge to organised labour to go global. A world factory demands a world trade union. The cry that higher wages mean higher unemployment is the oldest scare in capital’s playbook. And if we call a global minimum wage – or a global maximum working week, or a global minimum healthcare standard – pie in the sky, we’re saying that the green energy transition is the possible, necessary utopia, and fair pay and conditions the impossible, unnecessary one.

Both journeys have a terribly long way to go. The Phu My tower workers don’t talk about climate change much, and when I asked Hien via video call about Vietnamese and British workers competing against each other within CS Wind, he said it was too big a question. ‘It never occurred to me before,’ he said, ‘that workers in the West are unemployed.’",,,

- People don't think of everything. Saying it's an obvious solution only means it's obvious to you. I hadn't thought about it like that.

&gt; Popularity =/= truth

Sure, and I could argue that the overwhelming support of climate change by scientists doesn't mean its true. What it does mean is the people who study this closely have come to some form of agreement on the matter, and that consensus is worth taking seriously. **Do you have an alternate theory of truth you prefer?** The next most common is deflationary theory which doesn't seem to get you any further. All it does is reduce *truth* from the claim, essentially saying it is redundant. This wouldn't make correspondence theory wrong, just redundant. X isnt true because it corresponds with reality, rather, X is reality. The last thing you are left with are epistemic theories, which struggle from a serious bootstrapping contention. Take ""verificationism"" - Something is true if and only if (IFF) it can be verified. Well, what about the claim itself? Can you verify the claim that something is true IFF it can be verified? You can see where these types of epistemology-above-ontology methods have their problems.

&gt; Not absolute truth, the world's not binary. Even politifact rates truth on a spectrum.

When politifact say something is truthful on a spectrum, they are saying some parts of the statement are true, and some are false. 

&gt; I would say it's not objectively true that it's hot outside, based on people's tolerance for heat among other factors.

I would agree. You would have to be more specific. But, I would say it is objectively true that it is 88 degrees. Similarly, I would say it is objectively true that torturing kids for fun is wrong.

&gt; As best as we can subjectively understand it.

So have you decided to simply adopt a full-blown skepticism of truth? That is fine, but it would help our conversation if you could outline your position.

&gt; No, we don't. You're falsely equating physical reality with moral realism. Your point still wouldn't hold even if they were equivalent.

You need to give more than an assertion here. I have explained that it is not a false equivalency because both morality and the physical world are addressed through our subjective perceptions, and we should treat them similarly and consistently. Why shouldn't we?

&gt; Because morality is a concept, an invention of thought. The world is not.

Once again, you assert morality is an invention of thought. When humans come to know morality, how are you certain that we are *inventing* morality and not simply coming to know objective morality better. As humans come to know the physical world better, you don't say we are *inventing* the physical world. It almost seems silly that our minds are getting better at deluding ourselves (morality) and better at not deluding ourselves (physical world) at the same time.

&gt; I know you don't, but the list of inherent problems for objective morality is long.

You haven't provided any. It cant just be that we see morality differently - since people see the physical world differently, and you don't reject that there is an objective physical world. So give me the list.

&gt; In a world of subjective morality, consensus is the only way to create something resembling objective morality, using empathy as a standard.

Why? Who gives a shit? What value is **consensus**? What value is **empathy**? These are just **inventions of thought** right? 

&gt; That's why we have laws rather than rely on people to behave themselves.

We would certainly have them if objective morality is true. The difference is that they would be **justified** if objective morality were true. Without objective morality, they are just the illusory whims of the majority. **And as you said yourself, popular =/= correct**

&gt; Sure you can, the first step is to stop confusing the necessity of objective morality with its existence.

I don't confuse the two. Objective morality may be necessary and there be no objective morality. Of course. What I won't accept is the hypocrisy which is claiming on one hand that morality is just a list of personal preferences and, at the same time, that we should force people to abide by that list of personal preferences.  It still blows my mind that you can say ""morality is like art"" and ""we should put people in prison for assault, but not for liking different music"". ",,,

74,ewafmpr,,"I believe that there are a mix of factors taking place here. The most significant factor, and in my opinion the most reasonable, is a general lack of action over climate change. The scientific facts about climate change have been well understood since the 80s, at the latest. I think a lot of younger people feel that baby boomers just kicked the can down the road to them instead of making some hard decisions or sacrifices to slow or prevent climate change. 

The rest of the complaints I see are pretty stereotypical and less grounded in reality. I think there are some very strong criticisms of political policies that the boomer generation has enacted, but many boomers opposed those policies all along, so that's a difficult comparison to make. 

Also, I think some younger people feel that there is a good deal of hypocrisy amongst boomers with regard to things like technology. For example, you can look at the /r/boomerhumor subreddit and see lots of jokes about how young people are on their phones a lot, but I think older people have a lot of screen time as well. I don't know if that is specific to boomers, though.

Lastly, and I realize this has become a weird list, there was a level or privilege that many boomers had that they don't acknowledge. For example, look up the number of hours it took at minimum wage to pay for college in the 70s, and compare that to now. It makes it very frustrating to see when boomers try to, say, oppose minimum wage increases or student loan forgiveness. They benefited from a whole set of policies that they are now trying to prevent younger generations from accessing.",,,

**Standing firm on an ambitious battery regulation**

Last December, the European Commission published its proposal for a revision to the Battery Directive 2006/66/EC which aims to ensure that all stages of a battery’s lifecycle correspond to the ambitious goals of the Circular Economy action plan.

The Circular Cars Initiative underscores that this regulation, especially if implemented in its ambitious form, could become the world’s first ever sustainable battery law, underpinning the development of a green and competitive transition to electric mobility.

In particular, the Initiative calls for increasing ambition levels in recovery quota for lithium and upholding the requirement for battery carbon footprint disclosure to set the foundations for vehicle lifecycle-based assessments.

**End-of-life directive for vehicles**

Entering into force already two decades ago, Europe’s End-of-Life vehicle directive aimed to ensure safe and environmentally sound production, recollection, dismantling and disposal of end-of-life vehicles.

Among others, it prohibits the use of certain hazardous substances when manufacturing new vehicles and sets targets for recycling vehicles. However, the regulation has not been entirely successful as an estimated 35% of all vehicles in the EU are considered of unknown whereabouts at their end of life, and high-value recovery of materials used in vehicles remains elusive.

Instead, this rule for vehicles must be revised with a lifecycle perspective and improved data transparency. It should include targets for higher-value-retention processes (e.g. remanufacturing), recovery targets differentiated by material type and quality, carefully balanced content quotas for recycled materials, and well-functioning vehicle (de)-registration systems.

Given the transition to new supply chains with the transition to zero tailpipe emission drivetrains, and the increase in current car park replacement rate, the window of opportunity to shape the footprint of end-of-life is now.",,,

Since you are predictability outraged that someone could have a big political disagreement with you, I will now increase your outrage by writing down random center-right thought points that I may or may not follow.

1. Gay marriage should be a right, but congress should have passed a law, instead of Kennedy doing the anti-democratic thing and causing a debate that’s probably going to be as bad as abortion. 
2. Speaking of abortion, I would advocate a schedule of no abortions after the first trimester, unless there has been rape or incest, or if the fetus is non-viable. If there has been rape or incest, I would allow abortion until 24 weeks, unless there are very special circumstances (like a molester forcibly preventing abortion access for 24 weeks). If there is a life threatening emergency for the mother, I would allow an abortion at any time. If there is a special circumstance not listed here, I would hope that congress passes a democratically crafted law that addresses these (or which contains a safe Harbor clause). 
3. I am fine with taxation of wealth above 300 million inflation adjusted at a very high rate ~70%, with a capital gains tax of 40%, but which can be lowered if the person can create jobs paying 17$ an hour and which have less than 4X your work weeks. 
4. Free contraceptives on all the corners. 
5. The creation of a program like the old CCC that will be available exclusively for the combatting of climate change, such as by working at government rates in negative carbon industries, installing carbon scrubbers, etc. 
6. Build the wall, it’s far less wasteful than a billion other programs, though the racist undertones of its supporters is regrettable (or any other suitably condemning word :), and it can serve as part of a broader legalization strategy. 
7. Create a path for the dreamers to acquire citizenship within the next 3 years, and create a free accessible program to document all 11+ million illegal aliens.
8. Make illegal immigration a felony that results immidete deportation regardless, unless a person is literally dying, in which case they will be given medical care and then deported. 
9. Create a public option, if it fails miserably, hah take that, if not, healthcare for all who want it. 
10. Add an 18 year term limit as well as ethics regulations. The regulations will be enforced by having every judge in the United States have a say on weather a Supreme Court justice should be removed or suspended for gross misconduct, if the measure passed by 3/5, it will be sent to congress to pass as a bill, and then to the president to sign the final removal or suspension order. Create a special court composed of retired Supreme Court justices and chief judges of the circuit courts to determine the validity of the law within 30 days.

- Loves London's diverse culture, food scene but hate foreigners buying houses. How can London keep up with the diversity if only British citizens are allowed to buy houses? Wouldn't forcing all expats and foreigners to rent would make the housing situation worse? Also less taxes paid for government so even less public spending...
- Complains about high house prices but against ""luxury"" high rises which would alleviate some of the supply problems in London. It is true that some of the new builds are increasing prices for the area but wouldn't that also help locals sell their houses at a higher price? Not to mention more private investment to the area which should help the locals quality of life? Sure, some of the poorer families might have to relocate a bit but i think that is a necessary change for the future of the city.
- Complains about climate change yet against new builds which are better built and eco-friendly due to the energy efficient materials used in their construction
- Complains about safety/crime rates of some areas but also against redevelopments and investments through ""gentrification"". Fact is some of the gentrified areas are safer now or at least more welcome to outsiders of the area which would drive more business to the location and make this city even more livable/interesting etc

Edit: Unfortunately we don't live in a fantasy land so sacrifices or compromises have to be made. I think gentrification is a needed trend if this country and city wants to stay relevant and keep its quality of life in the future",,,

117,ct83vla,,"1. The guy didn't fight back, but I don't see how Levant's comments were in any way belittling the man. **Belittle**: to make someone or something feel less important or impressive. I don't think Levant did that at all. Porter used the wrong term, and that's not acceptable.

2. Porter corrected Lyla by rewording the original question. Also, it's clear the Lyla did not know what she was talking about. She couldn't get simple facts right, and appeared to say what most likely had been told to her by her mom. An example of this is when she said she knew nothing about Tesla, which is very well known and anyone with an interest in climate change would at least know the name of. Also, the mere fact that she agreed with Levant's points shows she didn't have any evidence to prove him wrong (and there's lots of evidence to prove him wrong). Also, her question was ""do you believe in climate change"" and he answered properly.

3. Making someone upset does not mean that you're personally attacking them. She was upset because he was calling her a hypocrite for not practicing what she preached. I still don't see any personal attacks, can you tell me which part of the video you're referring to?

4. Calling someone out for what they do isn't automatically personal. 
**Example**: I am against animal abuse. However, I wear a Canada Goose coat that has Coyote fur, and many have shown that the animals are poorly treated. Any animal rights activist can call me out for my choice because it is hypocritical. 

5. From the Star editor: **""While Porter told me Lyla did say the words she reported at some point after the encounter, that’s not what the camera shows. In journalism, the words within quotation marks must be the exact words stated so this misquote is a journalistic lapse caused, I believe by not doing the proper due diligence of taking careful notes on assignment for the Star. Certainly journalists need notes to support what they publish, especially when it puts someone in a bad light.""**

6. Levant wasn't caught in a lie. Not yet. Porter may have identified herself, but we don't know for sure. We can't assume either one is lying.
However, Porter was caught lying in other parts of her story, which gives doubt to her credibility.

Porter violated basic journalism standards, which is unacceptable. If the Star wants to have a good reputation, they would do right by firing her.",,,

It is wonderful to be here with all of you.
To be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.
To be right across the water from the headquarters of the United subreddits, where I represented our subreddit many times.
To be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt’s enduring vision of /r/Neoliberal, the subreddit we want to be.
And in a place… with absolutely no ceilings.
You know, President Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms are a testament to our subreddit’s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a subreddit and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.
Two Democrats guided by the — Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental /r/Neoliberaln belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.
President Roosevelt called on every /r/Neoliberaln to do his or her part, and every /r/Neoliberaln answered. He said there’s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous /r/Neoliberal: “Equality of opportunity… Jobs for those who can work… Security for those who need it… The ending of special privilege for the few… The preservation of civil liberties for all… a wider and constantly rising standard of living.”
That still sounds good to me.
It’s /r/Neoliberal’s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, /r/Neoliberal gets ahead too.
That bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.
It’s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.
It’s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.
When President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.
When President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.
But, it’s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.
We’re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.
Instead of an economy built by every /r/Neoliberaln, for every /r/Neoliberaln, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.
What happened?
Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our subreddital debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.
Except it wasn’t the end.
As we have since our founding, /r/Neoliberalns made a new beginning.
You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs… you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again – going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.
So we’re standing again. But, we all know we’re not yet running the way /r/Neoliberal should.
You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.
While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of /r/Neoliberal’s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.
So, you have to wonder: “When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?”
“When?”
I say now.
Prosperity can’t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.
Democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations.
Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.
You brought our subreddit back.
Now it’s time — your time to secure the gains and move ahead.
And, you know what?
/r/Neoliberal can’t succeed unless you succeed.


**That is why I am running for Mod of the /r/Neoliberal.**


Here, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each /r/Neoliberaln and the subreddit we cherish.
I’m running to make our economy work for you and for every /r/Neoliberaln.
For the successful and the struggling.
For the innovators and inventors.
For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.
For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.
For the nurses who work the night shift.
For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.
For the veterans who served our subreddit.
For the small business owners who took a risk.
For everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.
I’m not running for some /r/Neoliberalns, but for all /r/Neoliberalns.
Our subreddit’s challenges didn’t begin with the Great Recession and they won’t end with the recovery.
For decades, /r/Neoliberalns have been buffeted by powerful currents.
Advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of /r/Neoliberalns.
The financial industry and many multi-subreddital corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value… too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.
Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most /r/Neoliberalns have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they’ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.
Now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we’ve made as a subreddit, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.
Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire subreddit. And I will do just that — to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.
At our best, that’s what /r/Neoliberalns do. We’re problem solvers, not deniers. We don’t hide from change, we harness it.
But we can’t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.
/r/Neoliberalns have come too far to see our progress ripped away.
Now, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they’re all singing the same old song…
A song called “Yesterday.”
You know the one — all our troubles look as though they’re here to stay… and we need a place to hide away… They believe in yesterday.
And you’re lucky I didn’t try singing that, too, I’ll tell you!
These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.
We’ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.
Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they’ll say: “I’m not a scientist.” Well, then, why don’t they start listening to those who are?
They pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.
They want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million /r/Neoliberalns without offering any credible alternative.
They shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.
They want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.
And they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.
Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called “a village” that has a place for everyone.
Now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for /r/Neoliberal.
I believe that success isn’t measured by how much the wealthiest /r/Neoliberalns have, but by how many children climb out of poverty…
How many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive…
How many young people go to college without drowning in debt…
How many people find a good job…
How many families get ahead and stay ahead.
I didn’t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.
My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.
Her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.
You know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.
The 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.
The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.
And, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.
That’s why I believe with all my heart in /r/Neoliberal and in the potential of every /r/Neoliberaln.
To meet every challenge.
To be resilient… no matter what the world throws at you.
To solve the toughest problems.
I believe we can do all these things because I’ve seen it happen.",,,

However 280 scientific organizations and 112 Nobel laureates looked at the evidence and all concluded that GMO's are as safe as non GMO's.

No, I don't say it. The specie itself shows it. The argument of ""literally every other animal"" is kind of bad in this context aswell. You know why? Cause you prove that you **need to** compare our specie to another to justify a ""positive"" thing. Needing to compare our specie to another is a proof of lack of positive behaviour/facts.

Can you give me at least 2 examples of a positive thing **majority of people** did in centuries? And even if you find at least 1, you can then compare it to the bad things. Like wars, slavery, wage slavery now, climate change, nature being destroyed in profit of material comfort, violence, rapes, and so on. The list is pretty long.

For the homeless? For the animals dying everyday for our ""specie""? And again, the list goes on. They're just hypocrits.

For eg. When Jin said fans sometimes touch his face doesn’t like it, or when BTS really appreciated ARMYs doing the purple ribbon project, or when Jin and Tae told fans to stop pushing at airports.

It wouldn’t have changed a truly toxic fan sasaeng. But it did make sure the naive fans, the new fans are influenced by the vocal ARMYs on Twitter and realise the practice is bad.

Everyone just assumes that all ARMYs are hardcore KPOP fans who knew this stuff already but they’re not. A huge bunch have probably never even stanned anyone before. I’ve never stanned anyone I used to hear stories all the time of Indian stars coming to Australia and people running after them. I never did it myself becquse I found it ridiculous but never once thought omg that’s so horrible of them. But now I know how ridiculous it was of people who  ran after them going into their personal space. There’s bunch of naive fans who ARE 13-14 and have never realised these things and when they see bunch of ARMYs, the most vocal ARMYs rhat end up looking like all of ARMYs are not doing something, they’ll also know it’s not a great thing to do.

Yes there’ll be exceptions always and always. You can’t change a toxic person. But you can Atleast encourage conversation on a topic which prevents the VOLUME of those kind of fans. Otherwise why does ANYONE do a speech. Why does BTS’ speech at the UN even matter (other than we get to see them there and it’s pretty cool). But it’s all useless. Fans who don’t care about domestic violence or climate change are not gonna care anyway. But a bunch of people who never gave the topic a thought might look into it and end up becoming advocates. 


There’s  always a mix of people in any topic, people are educated and yet against a certain topic because they don’t care, people who are educated and people who are simply uneducated and don’t realise the impact of their actions because they never gave that topic a thought. This is VERY common. In this instance, it’s more than people think their actions don’t have consequences on the internet so they can say whatever. Someone sending a death threat on Interner won’t necessarily do the same irl because consequences.

So I don’t agree with unrealistic expectations from them allllllll the time. But I jsut don’t get the line of thought where apparently fans aren’t bts responsibility, kids, etc so they shouldn’t even bother. Like there has to be a better explanation than “why bother”.

&gt;You see I don’t give a shot about his color/race.

You will call the shooting a ""crockery"" but you won't call the shooter a domestic terrorist because he's white.

&gt;My issue is everyone in your side, including you makes a big deal about him. However, **if a person of coke** kills 3 people your side seems to be really quiet.

That's because I'm a Pepsi man of course. But more seriously there's an obvious difference between typical gun related crime and politically motivated terrorism. Also it's funny you point out black crime, but do you care about crime crime at all, even when white people do it? Also ""your side"" is another hyperbolic generalization. If you only watch right wing news, and it's pretty obvious you exclusively do, than of course you don't see the people who want to address gun crime. It's not a matter of being silent, it's that no laws concerning gun regulation can be passed despite the attempts. It's Democrats who have ideas on how to address these shootings and other gun crime, Republicans literally want to do nothing or add more guns to the situation.

&gt;Might as well complain that the sun is hot.

We can do things to mitigate how we are affected by the sun. Like wearing sun screen and going indoors to air conditioning. We can do the same for racism. Because it's very obvious that despite the persistence of racism, both in society and government, things aren't as bad as they used to be. But hey, at least we agree that racism exists and has tangible effects on society.

Also, it's extremely ironic you say there's no point in complaining about racism yet just before you're complaining about the nature of affirmative action and college admissions. You do think complaining about racism has its purpose, just when you feel whites are the one discriminated against.

&gt;Actually I do believe the welfare queen trope, but I also know it’s not just a black thing.

I'm sure you also know gun crime is not exclusive to black people either - but your knee jerk reaction to a white supremacist terror attack is ""crockery"" and ""what about people of coke"". You're in a room full of candles but that black candle is the proof you need of hypocrisy from Democrats.

&gt;I do believe that fatherless was is a problem.

I know you do, you've told many many of your beliefs. But what about the shooters who don't come from broken homes? If fatherlessness is an issue, and black families have higher rates of fatherlessness, why are we not seeing a higher rate of mass shooters who are black? It''s not really black people who are walking into class rooms with assault rifles. And to stress again, gang and drug related crimes are not the same kind of issue (motivation) as these other public killings. The only ones I can think of are the DC sniper and the recent subway attack. And the DC sniper was more attributed to the brain tumor he had and the lack of healthcare services available and people ignoring his complaints about headaches and severe mood swings. You blame divorce but how is forcing 2 parents in a loveless marriage going to prevent shootings?

&gt;Black men commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime alone to justify that disproportionate amount of policing, and prison population.

Or perhaps it's because of the over policing and the high rate of innocents convicted you think that black people deserve to be disproportionately policed. [Black people are 7 times more likely to be falsely convicted of murder](https://innocenceproject.org/facts-racial-discrimination-justice-system-wrongful-conviction-black-history-month/) than white people. The SCOTUS just ruled that against the idea that the Federal government can revue state cases if they suspect the person is innocent. It's like reversing the 1965 civil rights act. I guarantee if you policed a middle class neighborhood the same way you policed the ghetto you'd find more middle class criminality than you expect.

Follow the logic you just laid out - black men commit crimes at a higher rate therefore it's ok to have a greater police presence in the black community - most black people are not criminals, so to police them all because of a few based on the assumption of greater criminality - doesn't that sound like prejudice? They need protection, yes, but when they don't trust the police (rightfully so) how much protection are they getting?

&gt;Everyone can run around fucking but not be held responsible for producing a neglected child?

This is just another mass generalization that makes no sense. Are you trying to say Democrats are against Child Service departments and negligence laws for children? Those exist and are not controversial.

&gt;I would argue that most men leave these women because they are unbearable. Especially black women 🤷‍♂️.

So you're ok with no fault divorce if the wife is unbearable? I don't get why you bring this up.

&gt;Sorry for jumping to a conclusion that seems to be so normal these days. I can admit when I’m wrong tho.

That's very big of you. But you're not just wrong about the killer being trans.

&gt;Let me clear something up. Trump is definitely not a part of the swamp. He definitely contributed to it tho by donating to them for years.

And you don't question how despite being a DC outsider how he so quickly and thoroughly dominated the Republican party? Like he contributed to them, isn't that an aspect of being part of the swamp? The only caveat I'll give to calling Trump a swamp monster is that his goal was to rearange the swamp in his favor as the top swamp monster - that is why the other swamp monsters didn't like him. But besides that, he's part of the swamp IMO.

&gt;Freedom without responsibility and accountability creates what we have today. So yeah, that’s all Democrats.

You call certain Republicans Democrats then blame all Democrats, lol you're just being dishonest to yourself. The Republican party existed before 2016 you know.

&gt;So when you look at broken homes, do you think 51% of those people are competing for their kids love with toys?

Do you have any data on how kids are treated after parents are divorced? Because I was matching a trope for a trope to show how useless the generalization was. Do you have any data that suggest divorce leads to both parents abandoning their responsibilities to their child? 

&gt;I would bet that the men are so broke from being on child support that they are just happy to get the kid and spend time with them, and don’t have money for a bunch of extra toys.

There's 2 assumptions wrapped into this. First you assume that people who divorce are on welfare, and you don't factor in that most divorces end with the father paying alimony so welfare isn't a factor for either parent. Just like with the fatherless shooters trope you're going off an intuitive hunch rather than any real data.

&gt;Whatever the case is with college, it should be a flat acceptance. Do you disagree with that?

Without defining what that flat rate is there's nothing to agree to. Colleges employ multiple standards, like grades, test scores, extra-ciriculars, and yes economic need/background.

&gt;Do you not think that people can’t compete?

This again forces us back to the nature of merit. Who has a better chance passing the ""flat"" acceptance rate, poor people or middle class people? I think you know the answer, and I think you know simplistically referring to merit is not the reason why there's a difference.

&gt;Do you not think that we have more than enough colleges for everyone to attend?

No, that's why admissions standards and rejected applications exist, not everyone who applies can attend. But I would like to see more schools built in general.

&gt;Do you think it’s fair for white, Asian, and Indian men to HAVE to get at least 1400 on a test that everyone else only has to score 1100 on to attend the same school?

Source? Not all colleges go by the same score standards.

&gt;If that’s the case, why not just do it by lotto?

&gt;I don’t believe in climate change. ... We don’t have another planet to compare so the science is bunk.

lol what?? Even if you reject the man made theory, you agree the earth is getting hotter and that's bad, right?

&gt;How about instead of Congress sending $40b to a country completely full of bigots, we use that money to give everyone a solar roof setup?

This may surprise you, but we can do both. We can feed detained migrants baby formula and give American babies formula at the same time. That'd be great if Republicans in Congress wanted more solar and cheaper baby formula, [but they don't.](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-house-republicans-voted-against-fda-baby-formula-bill-1708036)

&gt;Once again, freedom without responsibility. 

Responsibility is a 2 way street. Spreading a highly communicable disease is irresponsible regardless if it injures fat people more. Being old isn't a choice, but you think old people have to be responsible for being old when people infect them? Like with the idea of merit you're taking a very narrow understanding of it to justify your beliefs. The government has a responsibility to protect people - or perhaps with this recent school shooting those kids should have understood that freedom means getting blasted away by a nut job, and they should be responsible for themselves getting killed.

Despite their posturing, most of these people we're talking about are terribly confused intellectually, so I'm going to have to go beyond their labels and offer a positive description of their worldview. But their worldview isn't quite consistent either. I apologize for the rambling. 

-- 

To begin, I feel like Hobbes, Nietzsche, Kojève, Fukuyama, and Huxley are on the money. The foundations of progressive worldview rests on the archetype of the Last Man. They abhor conflict, enjoy material pursuits, and otherwise want to live in a comfy technocratic paradise forever where everybody is equal and nobody even has a reason to rise above the mass. This requires a leveling of everything: ethnicity, language, religion, ideology, morality, intellect, health, the arts, even physical prowess. You don't need even need to speak precisely anymore since you no longer have the individual burden to understand the world. Society's problems are managed by journalists and economic experts, consumption driving society forward, and life goes on. Libidinal forces are encouraged because they provide more demand, and self-control only hinders economic growth. Conflict has been reduced to simmering bubbles instead of occasional stormy seas and rogue waves, and there's a steady stream of novelty to barrage the senses to keep you occupied forever. 

This is also why you have erratic progressives seething over anti-consumption lifestyles as ""fascist"", to the point where even old-school Marxists are being lumped into that category. The fascist cares about denying himself, dividing the world into good and bad, and embracing struggle, even if it is arbitrary and meaningless. So, even something as simple as working out, putting on muscle, looking good, and, worst of all, feeling some kind of ""objective"" personal *power* is psychologically dangerous to the Last Man. Remember, *self-denial means rejecting unchecked desire, the only driver of the entire system*. People who think there's a distinction between *the private and public are fooling themselves*, and we're only starting to realize that the latent ambiguity that we take for granted in our lives is a sign of something deeper. Micro-aggresions may be micro, but they are innately meaningful and show signs of difference. *Every action has a certain aesthetic to it that relates to a person's values, and we pick up on it intuitively*. Remember, this is a society that thinks the concept of virtue is outdated thanks to technological developments, and that the only component of morality we need is the ability to be nice, so everybody will get along. Anybody who tries to build virtue for any reason to differentiate themselves is a potential threat and is ""jinxing"" society into thinking that conflict may come back in the future. 

The rise of identity politics, for the most part, suits society perfectly. It serves as both a solvent for ""meaningful"" groups to dissolve into socially engineered groups, which then allows the socially engineered groups to serve as an outlet for human group dynamics, redistributing resources, channeling one's sense of ""justice"" that is otherwise denied into service of the entire system, etc. Many of these groups are libidinal in nature too. Consider LGBT activism, sex positivity, abortion rights, etc. It's nominally about freedom. But the freedom to do what? America is being increasingly confused about what freedom is for, as freedom for its own sake seems to be a nihilistic venture. The pursuit of happiness? But what makes us happy? Society has collectively decided that making money, having sex, and chasing novelty is what makes us happy. Anything that could potentially be a limiting burden, whether it is your hometown, your heritage, your religion, your morals, a sense of dignity (think about the constant advice against ""shame"", a complete contradiction against Aristotle's belief that shame was necessary for ethics), etc., is shunned. Statistics seem to show that this isn't what actually makes us happy, and every socioeconomic indicator, the rise of anti-depressants, and the decline of positive imagination shows us this, but I digress. Maybe we can be medicated out of the human spirit. 

So, to wrap this up, I want can offer four preliminary principles for describing the essence of progressive liberalism, it's this: 

* 1) it's always **pro-machine** (administrative-managerial-technocratic state); 

* 2) it's always **pro-desire** (libido is never wrong, endless consumption treadmill); 

* 3) it's always **anti-virtue** (unnecessary, judgmental, divisive, fascistic); and 

* 4) it's **anti-essence** (having names mean things impedes our ability to remold ourselves and the world on a dime and create an endless treadmill of novelty).

It may even be in that order from least to most importance, see how nobody was willing to advocate for abstinence or to campaign against obesity to prevent COVID. This is what allows for Baudrillard's simulacra machine to keep on churning. 

My priority system seems to explain everything about clown world except... racial identity politics. That's what terrifies me the most. There is **ONE** exception to the ""end of history"", ""no struggle"", ""don't care about anything"" habit. We are actively constructing a grand historical narrative and reorganizing society on **race**, which will have the consequence of reifying race by making it into an actual thing. This is striking because of the double-think involved, since we profess to believe that race isn't real, it's just skin-deep, etc., as we should. The thing is, social constructs are arbitrary, *but their impacts are real, as the way we see the world ends up impacting the way we shape it*. You can already see this impacting the world thanks to America's cultural hegemony with Europeans adopting American progressive worldviews and son on. And I think this is going to lead to revanchism, resentment, and even conflict on an unfathomable scale. Should the economic gravy train ever come to a screeching halt, perhaps due to a series of climate change related disasters, perhaps because the failson kids who believe their own bullshit hook line and sinker (instead of being Machiavellian) actually run the joint into the ground, people will wake up and realize that the Charles Manson's feverish dreams are about to become a reality.

Storage is a huge issue. Hydrogen is one way out but it doesn't go all the way. What I mean by that is that pure hydrogen is really hard to store. Compressing it takes loads of energy, very thick tanks and it still corrodes even stainless steel. That's why I really hope we find ways to process hydrogen to make methane with it.

There have been lots of trials with hydrogen for vehicles. Since atleast 15 years we had some H-buses in our fleet here in Berlin. But the weight and the very limited fuel stations (and the necessary infrastructure for that) are not optimal. The stuff is also quite dangerous (oh the humanity!).

It is much easier to use when mixed with methane (and possibly other gasses like carbon monoxide) and we still have some infrastructure for that because that's basically what city gas / illuminating gas is. This could be a way to distribute it and I know that some rural districts are already experimenting with it. But that's what it is - experimenting.

The one industry that seems to be going all in at the moment is the steel industry. They are investing heavily in carbon neutral smelting processes. Where hydrogen cannot be used, we will need straight electricity. I think we will see more and more time based electricity consumption contracts as are already common for arc furnaces in other industries.

But storage is a huge problem, as you mentioned. Lithium batteries are not economical on grid scale, lead batteries can't store enough and pump accumulators are only possible in some few parts of Germany. The rest is too flat. That's why we don't have much hydroelectric power in the first place.

I do remember that around 2000, most people assumed that fuel cells would become widely available. But afaik they don't scale well. Meaning they are easy to make - as long as they're small. I am certain that for example Siemens is investing heavily but I haven't heard much about results on a scale that's useful for the grid.

Whether nuclear really is cheaper in France or whether there are other reasons for the price difference, it is a politically dead technology in Germany. The owners got a huge golden handshake and the plants are going offline. There's no going back. I was actually quite critical of that development, believe it or not. But it is what it is here - unfeasibly expensive.

The only nuclear option I can imagine for Germany would indeed be MSTRs or something like that. Fuel depletion rate would have to be huge, the reactors small because we're afraid of terrorism and it can't have water as it's coolant because we vividly remember Chernobyl which had a measurable impact on German agriculture, unlike in France, I believe.

That is why up until three days ago, we planned to use gas as the ""bridge technology"" which would supply baseload when wind and sun don't yield enough. As you probably have heard, this will become less politically attractive by the day. With all these problems, the only way out I see is mixing energy imports from France, severely liberalizing the rules for small-scale and medium-scale (but local) solar and wind, hoping for increasingly cheaper technology to harness electricity from hydrogen or methane and keeping much more electricity from coal plants in the mix than we would have liked.",,,

If the DNC is going to cheat, they're going to do it with the amended rules they adopted after 2016, and the primary will be irrelevant. The candidate declaration allows the DNC chair to determine who is, or isn't a democrat, for purposes of certifying them as a nominee. (I'll link to this in a minute.)

We have a *slight* shot at single payer, with Bernie as president. He's not a magic wand, and his election, while not meaningless, won't do a thing to change the reality that Nancy Pelosi and centrist dems aren't going anywhere. They're not just going to magically disappear.

The Democratic party has spent the last 30 years telling me they don't need me, don't want my votes, and I'm not who they're interested in serving. If you object to that, you're going to have to take it up with them.

There were about 100m people in 2016 who were eligible to vote who didn't. IMO, it would make better sense to try and get enough of them to swing the democratic primary (I say this without a shred of snark: good luck. I don't think it'll make a difference, and Biden is *going* to be the nominee).

No matter what happens, no democrat is going to do what we *have* to do on climate change, and absent that, arguing over which party is in the white house is irrelevant.

Amended DNC convention rules for 2020 are here:

In any case, we're not actually talking about me, individually. The only way Green voters make a difference in the Democratic primary is if every last one of us votes for your guy, and Biden and Sanders are essentially tied in the delegate count, heading into the convention. Your hope here is that every single Green voter in the country will vote for Bernie such that he can eke out a first-round win by single digits, and avoid going to second round, where the superdelegates take over, and from there, it's all over.

This little video (sourced from [voice actor Gianni Matragrano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVueEr6GnHI)) reminds me of how new people must see the rest of us during their initial foray into r/collapse.

A few weeks back, I thought that u/fraterct made [a particularly insightful comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/nec4kb/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/gyhdf5m/?context=3) regarding their sudden and growing awareness of the difficulties that the future has in store for us. **With their thoughts in mind (quoted below), I'd like to open up this thread to ask some questions:**

* **How did you first become ""collapse aware""?**
* **How did you cope with your new knowledge?**
* **What changes have you made to your life for adaptation to an uncertain future?**

I look forward to you all sharing your advice.

\--

&gt;As a collapse newbie here (so obviously highly anecdotal), I think it's these, and timing-wise I think Covid is a major factor. I've lurked this sub on and off over the years but usually only when I got in a particularly depressive mood; it would hit the same spot in me as watching an episode of Black Mirror or something. But I still held on to my techno-hopium addiction, until recently.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's gone now.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not just economic issues, or watching the gradual slide into catabolic collapse in various day-to-day aspects of life. I saw all those things but still held on to the hopium because I thought that all it would take is one significant scientific discovery and we could start turning the corner to working together and undoing the damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Covid dashed that, because it's now demonstrably clear that there are countless millions of people who would rather let their communities, their families, and even themselves die before they will allow themselves even the slightest inconvenience like wearing a fucking mask in a grocery store. The unleashed horde of antivax/antimask Q-Anon Karens and ""evangelical"" hypocrites is like an orc invasion, I feel like I share almost nothing in common with these people, and I feel in my gut like they are a harbinger of modern society's undoing. If we can't politically agree to wear a damn piece of fabric, how the hell are we going to politically agree to do what needs to be done to deal with climate change in an orderly way, even if we had a technological solution ready to implement?  
&gt;  
&gt;But even without those Karens, it wouldn't matter anyway, because around the same time as accepting the above, I also learned about the lack of availability in rare earth elements required to support renewables on a sufficient scale, and how overall there just aren't enough resources left for us to ""break orbit"", in just about every sense of the word. And what few environmental actions the populace think it's taking, like recycling, turn out to mostly be grift and lies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Learning about the above starts a domino effect of learning about all the different waysthat our decline is locked in, like it's suddenly unfathomable to me that I didn't accept it before. We've been following the track of EROEI since the dawn of civilization, we've never escaped it, and we are hardwired by Mother Earth that we never will. Ashes to ashes,dust to dust.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've only really started allowing the implications of this to settle on me over the last week or so, and it hurts. It hurts a lot, and I'm very, very sad.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I also found myself this past weekend doing little things like watering our garden plants with more attention than I did, and noticing other little subtle shifts in where my mind was going. And it kinda does feel a little like coming out a long drug haze.  
&gt;  
&gt;I do feel like there is a future for some of us. I don't think humanity will disappear, but I accept that it'll dramatically reduce, and our carrying capacity will be only a fraction of what it is now. And I accept that the path to getting there will be filled with a lot of pain and death. But I also deeply feel like the survivors will not be the people who treat it like mad-max cosplay. We will have to accept the reality that some people will go down fighting in that way, and that this won't be pretty... but also that the communities that survive will need to be built on more than that at their core. I don't know what that looks like, but some deep part of me wants to find out. I want to see what happens to us. As a Gen-X'er I'm thinking I'll probably be around just long enough to know.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I also don't think it'll happen overnight. I guess it's pretty common for people new to collapse to let the initial grief turn into panic, but I've gone through panic before and I know it's not useful. It's going to happen over the course of years. But I need those years, because right now I don't know shit. I work with computers - which seems like a dead-end now in the long run, but for the time being it's a good enough industry to ride down the initial slope of the catabolic curve while I learn some practical life skills over the next decade or so.  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel so clueless, but I also feel sober. I don't know any other way to put it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I spent a number of years involved with a cult. Cults are always fucked up in what they do to your mind, and the leaders are always wrapped in narcissism etc. But some cults do wrap themselves around solid inner truths that precede the cult leader and which the leader just wraps a thin skin around. And if you can get to those inner truths without being consumed by the cult itself, you can get some real inner treasure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Learning about collapse, I'm now very, very happy I went through all that, and found that treasure. Because without it, I don't know if I'd be able to develop the resilience to survive what's going to happen. Instead I'm now filled with assurance that what is happening to us now is exactly what's supposed to happen. We are one with the Earth, we need to be reminded of that, and those who survive will remember the lesson for a long, long time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sorry for the long ramble. I guess I'm just saying this because I'm certain I'm not alone. More people are learning about this because more people are feeling somewhere deep in their bones that the peak has been crossed and it's not going to come back. We're heading into uncharted territory, and the answers to how to navigate it are not going to come from the sources we've grown up with.",,,
167,fdges5x,EU plans ‘big increase’ in green gas to meet climate goals,"What a hodgepodge of an article !

Yes it is possible to produce methane by fermenting organic material. Only if said organic material is procured from renewable sources can this methane be called renewable. *Bio* here does not mean *organic* nor *low carbon*.

Now, in Europe, most organic material are a product of the intensive agriculture, which is *not* renewable.

Part of the biogas we currently use comes from wastes, which is good, but demands that we produce vast amounts of food wastes in the first place, which is part of the problem much more that part of the solution.

Yes, it is possible to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis. *If* the electricity used here is indeed from a renewable source, *then* said hydrogen could be construed as a store of renewable energy. So the first step is to obtain a surplus of renewable electricity, which windmills do occasionnaly.

Like with everything *""green""*, `green gas` is an ill-defined concept that encompasses a wide variety of realities. It may happen that in *some* very narrow cases, the electricity so produce may indeed be both renewable and low carbon. In most cases though, it is not, and articles like this one amount to not much more than a lethal mixture of greenwashing, uninformed reporting and environmental circlejerk without much consideration for the industrial, economic and social realities.

no, this is conservative rhetoric that isn't foundational. ""they're coming here for hope of a better life""... NO FUCKING SHIT. that's the reason why just about all immigration and refugees flee where they're from and come here. A better life.

&gt; Overall the world can expect the population to spread around more evenly than what it's like today. That will create all sorts of opportunities for currently-void nations like Canada and for impoverished nations in paradise areas to be brought up to speed economically.

this isn't what happens though. People tend to migrate to places that encourage sustainability, living well, and comforts (think maslows hierarchy of needs). People don't spread out to just anywhere. They move to nations and locations that support societal and personal growth. Canadian's aren't going to get up and move to the african desert because of some void left by departing refugees.

My argument isn’t that this is new or that anyone should be surprised, nor do I want to deprive anyone of their right to speak. But these artist should be aware of who their fans are and there are consequences for taking public positions, which by the way is totally unnecessary for them to do, when those positions or the people the artist chooses to support alienated their fans.

I’m sure there are reasonable arguments on both sides of that issue but Dave Grohl’s isn’t one that I’m particularly interested and if he spends his time talking about it I’m less inclined to want to follow him or listen to what he has to say and possibly even seek out his music because his music is what drew me to him in the first place and I just have a low tolerance to hear even more politics from people who are in the realm of art when it is just as informed as some Joe Schmo on the street.

Check Manitoba where hydro is also plenty, especially with the previous NDP greenwashing every dam building as green energy powerhouse while racking up debt, Manitoba's PC were prepared to offer straight $25/ton carbon tax with measures and shows using economic modeling that their plan reduced more than the federal plan, Liberals said no, do what WE want.

Most provinces are on track to meet Paris target with exception of Saskatchewan and Alberta where both parties(Saskatchewan Party and Saskatchewan NDP; United Conservative Party and Alberta NDP) has been resistant to federal $50/ton in 2022 for different reasons, no need to elaborate on the right wingers, Saskatchewan NDP have opposed carbon pricing in their past as government while Alberta NDP famously said you either give me TMX or no increase to that amount in 2022 and Canada's climate change plan is dead without Alberta.

The Liberals have a special cap and trade section for Quebec(which Ontario joined) that operates in parallel that is projected to not be as strict as carbon tax at $50/ton.  It is not straightforward as using two distinct policy tools creates deadweight losses that the Liberals are only happy giving Quebec as the Manitoba example shows, maybe I am wrong and Liberal will go tough on Quebec in 2022, but I will not hold my breath.

How is this not National Energy Program 2.0 as implemented?  If Quebec is really as clean in hydro, higher carbon tax will not hurt as much in the same price, but noooo, Quebec wants a special deal and has the clout and lawyers to make it happen.

Really, Quebec will be the first ones to oppose federal intervention in areas it finds important to provincial autonomy, and I simply ask the same in energy and carbon pricing policy for the West, simple as that, if Quebec wants to keep its cap and trade, I am not going to call my MP to demand it be scraped, master in their own room, Quebec can be.  In the very alternative, treat all provinces equally and not play favorites, which the Liberals seems to be doing just that.

Economic output are very different and you would find an across the country carbon tax on the same price will make people actually able to cut emissions while not hurting economic output be where the cuts happen ideally, so in hydro rich Quebec and Manitoba to offset any hard disruption to green transition in oil and gas Saskatchewan and Alberta.

179,dw37abu,,"Blame everything on China, while not realizing our own faults. 

China is a developing economy and the most populous country in the world. Last few decades China obtained massive wealth and people wanted to improve their living standards. When 1.4 billion people rise out of poverty and now have the money to enjoy a lavash western lifestyle its bound to cause some environmental disasters. 

But you straight out blame China for this is wrong. Developed countries have been enjoying the kind of lifestyle Chinese now are seeking for decades. It is hypocritical to blame China for wanting something the developed countries have been enjoying for decades. The developed countries have caused just as much environmental disasters during their development as China, but we don't mention them because they happened a century ago.

A developing country the size of China will need massive amounts if raw materials, and this is just the beginning for China, India another massive country will soon follow in the near future. Rather than using them as scapegoats we need to cooperate.

The developed and developing countries should work together to fix this problem. It is not just a problem for China, the consequence affects the planet as a whole. There is the Paris Agreement many developed and developing countries signed to combat climate change together. This event is tragic but if governments can make a law that requires companies to replant the forests they chop down, and it is enforced and observed by the UN it can help to reduce the strain on our environment.

&gt;It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place. Many are starting to ask themselves, “What will it take for the people in power to wake up?”  
&gt;  
&gt;But let’s be clear: They are already awake. They know exactly what they are doing. They know exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to maintain business as usual. The leaders are not doing nothing; they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system. This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature and the destruction of present and future living conditions to take place.  
&gt;  
&gt;The COP has turned into a PR event where leaders are giving beautiful speeches and announcing fancy commitments and targets, while behind the curtains the governments of the Global North countries are still refusing to take any drastic climate action. It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo.  
&gt;  
&gt;And COP26 has been named the most exclusionary COP ever. This is not a conference. This is now a Global North greenwash festival, a two-week-long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah. The most affected people in the most affected areas still remain unheard, and the voices of future generations are drowning in their greenwash and empty words and promises. But the facts do not lie, and we know that our emperors are naked.  
&gt;  
&gt;To stay below the targets set in the Paris Agreement, and thereby minimizing the risks of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control, we need immediate, drastic, annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen. And as we don’t have the technological solutions that alone will do anything even close to that, that means we will have to fundamentally change our society. And this is the uncomfortable result of our leaders’ repeated failure to address this crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the current emissions rates, our remaining CO2 budgets to give us the best chances of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius will be gone within the end of this decade. And the climate and ecological crisis, of course, doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is directly tied to other crises and injustices that date back to colonialism and beyond, crises based on the idea that some people are worth more than others, and therefore had the right to steal others — to exploit others and to steal their land and resources. And it is very naive of us to think that we could solve this crisis without addressing the root cause of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not going to be spoken about inside the COP. It’s just too uncomfortable. It’s much easier for them to simply ignore the historical debt that the countries of the Global North have towards the most affected people and areas. And the question we must now ask ourselves is: What is it that we are fighting for? Are we fighting to save ourselves and the living planet, or are we fighting to maintain business as usual?",0,,

For example, with regard to E coast flood zones (where property losses are influenced by interannual variability of sea level, as well as storm surge, vertical land motion, and global mean sea level rise), the insurance is heavily subsidized by the Fed's. He felt that the property and risk markets are so far out of equilibrium that it would be unwise to place bets on sea level rise impacts, yet. By simply extrapolating the mean sea level rise and predictable ocean tides, you could quite reliably predict ""sunny day"" flood events in Annapolis, Md, and you could probably make a reasonably accurate prediction of the added economic costs related to this kind of flooding, but to make money off of this you would be betting against an opponent with effectively infinite resources to mitigate short-term losses.

Investors with sufficient resources are likely placing long-term bets, but they probably won't pay off for another 20 to 50 yrs. The current rate of mean sea level rise is about 1.5 inches/decade. It is not much, but it has been leading to observable impacts especially in places where land subsidence is also occurring.

""I don't care""

If you don't care about them, then you don't care about an entire subsection of people who, regardless of what they believe in, are good people simply trying to find meaning in their lives. That's the thing: we need people who care about other people regardless of their beliefs. 
""and this is what the Borg currently does, to serve their own aims. If I just wanted to manipulate people, I'd do that, bible or no bible.""

(Excuse any improper formatting, I am new to reddit). What if the ends were not manipulation, but simply an honest search into the truth behind God, the validity of the Bible, and ways we can live to help the fact that we are living in terrible times. It could be a transparent organization that includes all of the points that are considered contradictory, and one that is actually based on love rather than power and hypocrisy. Of course no religion is perfect, but it'd be a role model organization. 

As for the rest of your arguments, I understand that there is a lot of contradiction in the Bible. Many of the prophecies either fail or are so vague that they could be retrodicted various times over history. But, to an extent, there is some contradiction in the following statement: 

""Behaviorally, the bible follows a simple altruism that human dynamics are going to naturally evolve to engender because humans are stronger when they stick together.""

Of course, evolution accounts for many of our behavioral traits. Therein lies the problem. How will we ever achieve anything truly in this world as humans if our ""natural behavioral instinct"" is to act in self-interest or in the interest in only our species? The world shows it: war, deforestation, climate change, and hunger are all a result of people acting according to their ""human dynamics"" and ""evolving"" to survive. Humans do stick together; but only to the extent of their own comfort. How can this be combated without having a unifying law that specifically barres people from acting solely on self interest? This is where I see the potential in the organization: a way for a unifying law to, in a way, *coerce* people to think in a non-selfish way. This has been effective already to an extent, but it has been muddied by the unfair and power-hungry laws that do not achieve anything but muddy the waters. 
What I suggest is we ignore the bad parts of the Bible and focus on the good. There must be an explanation as to why the Bible gets so much wrong. It could be that simply humans need a God to make sense of their lives. Maybe the Bible was a botched attempt to understand and interpret a God that really did interact with us. In either case, no one has all the answers. But if anything, I still believe that, if this organization would change, it would make a huge difference in this world. I just hope it can...

(PS, please send me more information on Tyre and any other failed prophecies, I have some reading to do. Thanks.)

204,hkpolya,Top executive Van Beurden: Shell is not leaving because of the business climate,"**Why is this step necessary?**

We want to simplify our share structure. From two shares to one share. We have a clear strategy. We have a new reorganisation. We now have to go through with adapting our structure to become a faster and more agile company. We no longer want the handcuffs that impose enormous restrictions on our business below the surface. We have worked with them for years, but they have become increasingly unworkable.

**What can't you do?**

We recently sold our operations in the Permian Basin in the US (for $7bn, ed.). I want to return money to shareholders, but it's not as easy as I would like. It will take a year and a half. I'll end up getting questions from shareholders about that: ""what are you doing about it?"". And if we want to make acquisitions or sell parts, everything has to be seen through the lens of the A and B structure of our shares all the time.'

'That's getting harder and harder. As we have to go faster and take bigger steps in the energy transition, that is becoming more and more of a limiting factor. So we have to do something about that. This has nothing to do with our plans in the Netherlands. In fact, without our investment opportunities in the Netherlands, we cannot have an energy transition plan for Europe.'

**It was not possible to simplify the structure while maintaining the headquarters in the Netherlands?**

We looked at all kinds of options. We could make our shares all A-shares. but that would mean that our B-shares, 50% of the share capital, would then fall under the dividend tax of the Netherlands. Today, we no longer have the luxury of saying to shareholders ""you know what: this is easier for us, too bad for you"". We have enough problems in the sector. We cannot afford to offend shareholders.'

**A little over a year ago you said in the FD that Shell was considering moving its headquarters. Apparently the government has not succeeded in retaining you?**

We've been talking about it for sixteen years. At the time we decided that we would become a British company, but with headquarters in the Netherlands. At the time, the expectation, also expressed by the government, was that the dividend tax in the Netherlands would eventually disappear. That was problematic, because the English shares had a different dividend structure than the Dutch ones.

So for us it was clear: this is temporary. In time, the dividend tax will disappear. We have been discussing this with the government for 16 years. I have always been clear: this has to be solved, otherwise it stops.

That was yesterday. It can't be a surprise that we need this solution. The only way left if the dividend tax is not abolished, and which is guaranteed to work, is what we are proposing now.'

**To what extent does the negative sentiment against big companies and Shell in particular play a role in this decision?**

Not really. Of course I am also disappointed by the lack of national pride and the lack of recognition for what we do. If I invest a billion, it is called greenwashing. Of course that stings. But that can never be a consideration for taking such a decision. The reality is that there are three times as many people who are positive about us as negative.

**Shouldn't the Netherlands be worried about the business climate? Unilever left earlier.**

This is not a business climate issue. Otherwise we would not invest €4 billion in the Netherlands. We have also done a lot of good things together with the government, like the biofuel project in Pernis and we have worked out how to do the hydrogen project on the Maasvlakte and we are in dialogue to see if we can work in some way on the Tata Steel solution. Practically speaking, we have no problem working in the Netherlands.'

**To what extent does the court case you lost earlier this year against Milieudefensie play a role? Is Shell now avoiding the consequences of that verdict?**

Absolutely not. We have an obligation to perform. It doesn't matter where we put our tax shelter. That judgment is stuck to us and we accept that. Even if we wanted to, we wouldn't even be able to.'

It has to be a gradual shift with clear outlines so businesses can plan for the future while maintaining in the short term. If that doesn’t happen it’s going to be a bad time for everyone.

This is where we disagree.  I see climate change as devastating for our economy if we do nothing, therefore we must act now to prevent the worst from occurring.  In reality, even the most aggressive policy shift is far too late to prevent widespread economic damage.  There is no point in maintaining our current way of life today if it's just going to get completely annihilated in the future.  Moving to a fossil fuel-free economy will generate a large number of jobs, just not so many in the fossil fuel industry.  But I have no qualms with completely destroying the economic status quo.  These are the same fools who gave us the housing crisis in 2007, and I see absolutely no reason to continue to let them steal taxpayer money to bail them out when they fuck up.",0,,

They have had a climate change denier in the position of DECC and the new guy at DWP hangs around with gay therapy sorts. They also expanded charter schools to let some schools teach creationism..

They say they are the greenest government ever, but in fact they've stopped many of the initiatives and subsidies to green industries. They've gutted the civil service, and along with it the environmental and health and safety inspectors, so companies can get away with a lot more. They are forcing fracking by taking away people and council's right to protest against it

They've introduced councils to the free market..slashing funding and letting councils fund themselves from business rates and taxes..of course the councils with most business are Tory governed. If the Tories get their Brexit, lets how how quickly they get rid of environmental standards and workers rights.

They are taking power away from the workers in the form of strict union legislation, including rules for ballots that if they were used for elections, would see very few MPs elected.

NHS..they are defunding it as the Republicans do..and telling people it doesn't work. They are flogging off large amounts of the potentially most profitable parts so they can say that that its failing more. They are refusing to ask for a TTIP opt out for the NHS so they can sell off more.

Immigration. As we are part of Europe they can't change anything from the EU..yet. But Britain has some of the strictest immigration rules in the world for non-EU people. They've made it a lot harder for graduates to stay and they are trying to kick out people who earn less than £35k a year, which is getting on double the average wage for outside London.
