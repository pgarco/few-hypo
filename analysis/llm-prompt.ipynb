      "Accusations of hypocrisy are when someone accuses someone or something of being a hypocrite because of a moral contradiction between what they profess and their actions or words. Accusations of hypocrisy are sometimes direct such as \"You are a hypocrite\" and sometimes are understood via context, by highlighting a connoted inconsistency between what people profess or claim their believe and what people actually do. An example would be criticizing a celebrity for using a private jet while publicly claiming the need for climate action.\n",

The primary consideration to decide the accusation type is the content of the targeted action, statement or position. For instance, consumer choices typically indicate personal moral hypocrisy, while explicit political action such as voting or protesting indicates political hypocrisy. If the content is unclear, the type of actor being accused can guide the decision: accusations against nations or governments are usually political, whereas accusations against private citizens are typically personal.\n",
