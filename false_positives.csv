Lie 1a. You can't just claim they don't have the money when they already twice (linked) demonstrated they DID have the money by sending the people to other camps with better services. The new and for-profits camps are paid $750-775 per child per night, there is no rational application of math that takes you from being paid $750 per night per kid to not affording soap, blankets, combs, toothpaste, and food. No, it's intentional.

&gt; Perhaps the democrats really do have a problem accepting facts. 

&gt; So you believe congress just passed an unnecessary billion dollar emergency funding bill for fun? You seem smarter than that. 

See: the two links that you ignored, it shows the opposite in both cases. Dems voted for bills in both houses allowing more aid because they can't directly control conditions. The Dem bill required conditions improved for the children with funds to help it pass. GOP bill gave no standards for care improvement and even had a rider for funds for Pentagon. I'd love to see how you spin that.

&gt; They wouldn't be there if congress hadn't passed the laws that Trump is enforcing. They wouldn't be there if there were less lawbreakers trying to game the system. There are a lot of scenarios. I don't accuse you of lying because you don't list them all.

Well thanks for not accusing me of lies whilst lying. When I said pre-Trump, I said it because of Trump. I meant what I said. Trump in April 2018 changed civil charges to criminal and detained asylum seekers. That wasn't through Congress. Trump changed protocol to allow detention of those who would not have been detained, and in doing so he created a legal violation through Flores. Congress got involved until Trump promised to not detain over the 20day deadline, but Trump's still doing it. Trump by rule is not ""enforcing"" the law, he changed DoJ policy and ended up VIOLATING the law.

&gt; if conjunction

It is what he said, it's what he's been saying, it's even what his team has been saying. Just a tip, this is a poor time to double down on the ""if"" as if Trump hasn't been calling conditions good if not perfect, given the Pence video from last night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B29-zYvMdAE&amp;feature=youtu.be Enjoy Pence saying to the press that ""each and every one of the children... and parents that I spoke to told me they were being treated well"" just after coming out of camps of 400 people packed with little space and lots of stench, and his own OIG report listing conditions failures. You can see on video exactly how he twisted it.

&gt; Secondly we don't really know how much the tax cut helped because the Fed rose interest rates. We do know they helped. Just not how much. 

You're hedging an ""I don't know"" on details between ""a little"" and ""not at all"" consequence of a $1.5 Trillion tax cut? Is that really the hill conservatives want to stand on?

What they describe as ""new"" is funding coal and nuclear, while cutting green research for CO2 reduction that you celebrated.

Fucking what? No really, please explain this better. The left is backing the research, as well as backing research to adjust for green tech risks, and you think referencing something that is already being dealt with is ""trying to sidestep?""

&gt; I'm just saying that California soccer mom who drives a prius and votes democrat also has strange views on vaccines. I'm sure you could Google Hollywood antivax for yourself. 

I did. The very first link was talking about the public partisan backlash against anti-vacc celebs. ""...In recent years, however, vaccine policy has taken on a partisan bent, with Republicans tending to favor looser immunization mandates, according to Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings School of Law in San Francisco who studies vaccine laws...In California, lawmakers have proposed tightening rules to make it more difficult for parents to obtain medical exemptions that allow them to keep their children unvaccinated...State Senator Richard Pan, the Sacramento-area Democrat who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, is a pediatrician with a master’s degree in public health. He lamented Ms. Biel’s foray into the political debate."" Oops? Want to try another?

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/jon-stewart-veterans-burn-pits-gop-cruelty/?utm_source=reddit.com

&gt;Senate Republicans last week provided Americans with a vivid example of their party’s abject cruelty when they rejected the PACT Act, which would provide veterans with benefits to cover the health consequences they endured from exposure to burn pits while serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. They did so even though many of those same Republicans approved a nearly identical bill in June.

&gt;For a tutorial on how to respond to the lies and heartlessness Republicans have shown here, Democrats should turn to an unlikely source: comedian Jon Stewart.

&gt;The GOP’s reversal on the bill seems to be motivated by payback. Republicans voted against the PACT Act because they were angry over the agreement between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the Inflation Reduction Act, the reconciliation package that includes tax hikes on the wealthy, subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage and investment in green energy. The deal was announced just hours after the Senate passed its bipartisan bill to enhance national security and U.S. competitiveness against China by investing in semiconductor manufacturing.

&gt;Jon Stewart joined Democratic lawmakers in the District on July 28 after Senate Republicans blocked a new plan to help millions of veterans. (Video: The Washington Post)
In other words, Republicans threw a temper tantrum because they would no longer be able to hold the semiconductor bill hostage to block passage of the Democrats’ popular agenda. Think about that for a second. Republicans took their frustrations with Democrats out on sick veterans. That’ll show them!

&gt;In the days since the GOP stalled the bill, Stewart was unflinching. He went in front of cameras on Thursday to express what many Americans were feeling. Regarding Republicans’ about-face on the bill, Stewart said he was used to the “hypocrisy,"" “lies” and “cowardice” of politicians, but “I am not used to the cruelty.”

&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) offered a patently false excuse that the bill would create “pork.” In fact, the funds are delineated for a specific purpose. As Stewart tweeted: “The PACT Act is a stand alone bill. The PACT Act has no spending unrelated to Veteran’s Health and Benefits. There is no ‘Pork.’ There is no budget maneuver that then allows Dems to backfill [with] whatever they want.”

&gt;Stewart, appearing on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, kept up the barrage:

 
&gt;Republicans will likely come crawling back to approve the bill now that they have been exposed as deceitful, malicious and petulant. But Democrats should learn from Stewart and apply his techniques in other contexts.


&gt;In the abortion realm, Democrats should be clear. It is the height of dishonesty to say that abortion bans, which would endanger women’s health and lives, are “pro-life.” And it is simply untrue that these bills are about preventing abortions moments before delivery, as so many Republicans claim. The Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban third-trimester abortions. All but a handful already did before the Dobbs decision. One percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks and far fewer in the third trimester. It is a lie to say abortion causes women emotional distress or physical injury or that abortion is dangerous.

&gt;And it is cruel and barbaric to demand that a teen rape victim endure pregnancy and labor or to demand a woman with chronic health conditions risk pregnancy. Only monsters would insist that doctors wait until women are so sick that they might die before they can receive appropriate medical treatment, which includes abortions.

&gt;Stewart is a gifted communicator. His basic approach — righteous anger, blunt language, mastery of the facts, determination to call out the GOP’s bad faith — is something all Democrats should follow, whether the topic is veterans’ health, abortion, the Jan. 6 insurrection, guns, climate change or just about anything else. Enough is enough.

As I said, yes the planet needs to reduce its meat consumption but that isn't far off from the current consumption levels overall. The majority of meat consumed is concentrated in certain countries but if those were reduced and everyone was to eat balanced diets.

24,llama,"# “A Huge Mistake.” The E.U. Jeopardizes its Climate Goals By Labeling Natural Gas as Green

By *Ciara Nugent*

A long-simmering debate about the future of natural gas has been forced to a head in Europe this month, as the E.U. considers classifying some projects involving the fossil fuel as sustainable investments in official advice for the private sector due to be published by the end of January.


Burning natural gas produces carbon dioxide—but around 50% less than burning coal. The E.U. gets 22% of its energy from natural gas, and to meet its ambitious climate targets, the European Commission says it needs to cut use of the fuel by 37% by 2030. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, says the world needs to stop all investment in new gas and oil projects from 2021 onwards in order to keep on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050.


So it surprised many when, on Dec. 31, a draft version of the E.U.’s green energy taxonomy—a long-awaited list of investments the bloc considers sustainable for the planet—said that natural gas projects should count as green under certain conditions. (Nuclear energy, which does not emit greenhouse gases but carries other environmental risks, also got a controversial inclusion).


On. Jan 12, a coalition of influential investors including BlackRock, Vanguard and most of the world’s largest asset managers sent an open letter to E.U. representatives urging them to rethink the inclusion of natural gas in the taxonomy. “It is our view that the proposals in the [draft] would seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance, potentially triggering a ‘race to the bottom’,” the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change wrote, “which could dilute the level of climate ambition within emerging jurisdictional taxonomies.”


With the private sector trying to overhaul its spending to meet a deluge of environmental pledges made in recent years, the goal of the taxonomy is to guide money to the right places and hasten the energy transition.


The taxonomy, a technical document, has become a political battleground for warring visions between member states over the future of natural gas. One side—including many Central and Eastern European countries and Italy—argues that Europe needs to invest more in natural gas as a “bridge fuel” from even-dirtier coal and oil to a fully clean energy future. The other side—including Sweden, Austria, Spain, Ireland and others—says that the E.U. needs to discourage investment in all fossil fuels including gas inside its borders, and instead channel every available resource into ramping up renewables, which make up only around 17% of Europe’s energy supply.


The debate has divided the E.U.’s two largest economies. Germany’s government, a coalition including the Green party, has said the draft taxonomy amounts to “greenwashing,” while France has backed it, largely because it includes nuclear energy, the country’s main energy source.


The draft text has sparked fierce backlash from environmentalists across the bloc, who warn that the E.U.’s green credentials for gas—even with conditions attached—will have implications far beyond the natural gas market in Europe, confusing investors around the world and providing cover for the fossil fuel industry in developing countries.


”As a bloc, we are losing a lot of the legitimacy we need to convince others to shift their policies in order to achieve climate sustainability,” says Mounir Satouri, a Green member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France. “This is a huge mistake.”


## The case for natural gas as a transitional fuel

Wind and solar power are becoming very cheap to install, but we still lack some of the technology to store their energy for longer periods when the wind isn’t blowing or sun isn’t shining. Advocates for natural gas argue that it’s easy to store, and power plants running on the fuel can be turned off and on as needed, making it a great complement to renewables for the next decade or so.


The E.U.’s taxonomy labels natural gas as a “transitional fuel,” and investments in it will count as green if power plants produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour and are equipped to burn lower carbon gases, such as green hydrogen. Any new natural gas project must also replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31, 2030.


The green label “will certainly unlock some investment. But that will be very focalized in those markets where there’s still quite a lot of reliance on coal: in central and eastern Europe and perhaps Germany,” says Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of global gas research at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.


The E.U. aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 in order to stay on track to avoid the worst of climate change. Classing some natural gas as green is a pragmatic decision to help coal-reliant member states shift off coal more quickly and meet that target, according to Christian Ehler, a German MEP from the center-right European People’s Party. “Poland is not jumping from coal to wind [turbines]—there will be a step in between. So politically there needs to be a compromise,” he says. “If a national energy mix includes gas in order to fulfill the 55% ambitions, why should that harm either the environment or the commonly formulated goals? I think this politics of symbolism has to come to an end if you really want to reach those goals.”


## Muddying the green waters

But environmentalists reject the idea that natural gas is needed as a bridge fuel. “This transitional mentality arguing in favor of ‘less bad’ energy forces could have worked a couple of decades ago,” says Jakop Dalunde, a Green MEP from Sweden. “But today, in a climate emergency, we have to have full focus on energy sources that are truly sustainable.”


Granting natural gas a “green stamp,” he adds, could divert money from investments in clean energy—a problem, given renewables capacity needs to expand by 12% ever year to stay on track for net zero at 2050, per the IEA. “This [taxonomy] is about the long-term future we want to encourage. Fossil fuels have no place there.”


Though the taxonomy includes fairly stringent conditions for natural-gas projects to be classed as green, campaigners are concerned that it will be difficult to hold projects accountable for meeting them, says Tsvetelina Kuzmanova, a sustainable finance policy advisor at European climate think tank E3G. For example, power plants would need to switch to 100% low-carbon gases by 2035 under the rules, but the technology does not yet exist to run a gas power plant only with low carbon gases, so it is unclear how a gas project seeking green funding in the present would prove it can eventually do that.


Kuzmanova says that any expansion of natural gas poses a threat to the E.U.’s short-term goal on methane—a potent greenhouse gas with 80 times the warming power of CO2—which is the main component of natural gas. At COP26, the U.N. climate conference last November, the E.U. pledged to cut its methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Leaks from natural gas infrastructure are one major source of methane emissions, while the rest mostly come from agriculture. “Reducing natural gas infrastructure really should be the low-hanging fruit on methane,” Kuzmanova says.


## The impact beyond Europe

Climate campaigners also worry about the wider signal that the move sends on the urgency of phasing out gas. The E.U. has presented itself as a climate leader for the world in recent years, says Marie Toussaint, a Green MEP from France. “If we then say natural gas can be a sustainable investment, the message that other countries get is that it’s still okay to keep producing gas for many years,” she says, adding that other governments may follow the E.U.’s example but fail to impose the same limiting conditions on gas investments.


Analysts say policy makers in South Korea followed the E.U.’s discussion closely when drafting their own sustainable energy taxonomy, published in December, which also classifies natural gas as a transitional fuel.


And, though the taxonomy is meant only as advice to the private sector, Toussaint says she sees its influence in other E.U. legislation that lawmakers are reviewing as part of the European Green Deal. The European Investment Bank also aligns its lending with the taxonomy.


For Dalunde, the Swedish MEP, a taxonomy that includes natural gas is a wasted opportunity to deliver the level of climate ambition the world urgently needs. “This taxonomy had the potential to be one of the most consequential decisions that we take on climate change, not only for Europe, but globally, because other nations will take inspiration from it,” says Dalunde. “It could have been a quiet revolution. But the inclusion of fossil gas would really undermine that.”",0,False,2,"The article reports on a controversy surrounding the EU's decision to label natural gas as a ""green"" energy source, despite its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

Firstly, the TPP includes more stringent environmental protections and standards. But this is a trade agreement for which all members already agreed to the COP Paris climate change agreement. I'm not sure where your issue is here.

&gt;The investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows foreign corporations bypass U.S. law

I hate this argument!!!! ISDS doesn't allow corporations to challenge laws they disagree with. It gives corporations the power to stop countries from violating the free trade agreements. Without an enforcement mechanism, we can't have free trade.

For example, in the 1990's Canada banned the import of a harmful gasoline additive called MMT. The ban was challenged by an American company and was successful. The reason for the challenge was not the ban on the chemical, it was challenged because Canadian companies were allowed to keep selling it while Mexican and American companies could not. This violated NAFTA, and without provisions like ISDS, there is no way to challenge unfair treatment. Without it, there is no point in having a FTA. 

&gt;Does not require all countries to be in full compliance with international labor standards

What it does is enforce higher labor standards than currently exist in developing countries. We give them an incentive to improve. I'm sorry, but you can't expect developing countries to have the same standards as the developed. By making this a condition, you are effectively hindering their economic opportunity. Access to the American Market, economic growth and increased wealth are the best way to improve labor standards and living standards. By asking for first world standards, you are effectively banning them from competing, making the poor poorer, and doing nothing to improve the situation. 

&gt;Does not protect from foreign state-owned and state-subsidized companies and their predatory tactics

Yes it does. Not sure where you got this info. Countries can block predatory behavior which will hold up in any ISDS dispute as a result; so long as there is evidence.

You can't have both protectionism and trade liberalization. This isn't hard to understand.

Those are actually being forced on Americas allies. America already has the same rules for domestic pharmaceuticals. A lot of TPP partners aren't happy about it but it is a provision that benefits America greatly.

This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature and the destruction of present and future living conditions to take place.

4,gpt35,"I have been saying this before and always got down voted.  Not just Hybe but BTS as well.  All their so-called activism are performative. 

Hybe/BTS picked and spoke out only on ""safe"" topics, but are silenced on other less ""trendy"" issues, even when the issues are more relevant for them.

For example, how does BLM impact BTS, as Korean citizens, more than the widespread bullying or misogyny problems that are currently rampant in Korea? LGBT rights? Digital sex crime? (Actual Korean ARMY were targeted victims).

What about rising cost of living? Affordable housing? Work life balance? Pressure to be succesful? 

Korean millennials refer to themselves as part of the Sampo generation, a neologism that translates to the “three sacrifice generation” – one where young Koreans feel like they must give up relationships, marriages and children to survive the cut-throat economy. 

The Sampo generation quickly becomes the n-generation with n stands for the increasing additional numerous sacrifices (homeownership, etc.), not just 3, 4 or 5.

[Well, millennial around the world are facing similar social economical issues actually.]

BTS, for a short period of time, was part of the President envoy. They could use this opportunity to have a meaningful discussion with Predisent Moon about the various issues that Korean youths are facing. 

We don't have expectation that BTS or Moon would have solutions, but just an awareness discussion, a planting the seed discussion, a small step start for politicians to focus their efforts, would be nice.

Yet outside of photo ops and media press run for PR, nothing. 

Honestly speaking, I'm generally okay with performative activism as it still has the benefit of raising awareness.

What I'm not okay is the hypocrisis. 

Yes, kpop materialistic overconsumption is bad for the environment overall, but NFTs are so so much worse, esp. when NFTs offer no sentimental value as kpop fans overwhelmingly prefer physical, tangible merchandise like photocards.

Don't be fronting like you care about climate change, then turn around and push NFTs as products.

P.S.

For the blindly devoted BTS/Hybe stans, who love to use fallacies to derail/muddle conversations to defend BTS/Hybe, (fallacy like if you really care about climate change, you shouldn't be buying albums either cuz photobooks kill trees), yes, it'd be nice to stop buy albums and merchandise to save the trees, but pretty sure that those stans would cry foul if no one buying their
 faves' albums.

We have a couple of posts in the past that brought up kpop overconsumption and its environment impact, and the overwhelming responses are always dismissive: 

1. Kpop fans are small potatoes. They don't make any difference. Go after the big corp. Go after the rich billionaires. Hybe is a big corporations, no? BTS are rich, no? But it is still not okay for us to demand social responsibilty from them? 

Or 2. Albums and photobooks don't have as much negative impacts as fossil fuel, deforestation or carbon omission. Go after the ones that have the big impact. Well, NFTs are lot worse for the environment than photobooks. But now we can't fight NFTs either because your fave suddenly support NFTs?

WWF also accused the Commission of bowing down to pressure from France and its pro-nuclear allies.

Who are these dense idiots? How the hell do they think nuclear harms the wildlife while solar/wind and their petrol backup do not? Are they seriously calling this agreement anti-science when they can't do basic maths?",0,False,2,"The commenter is criticizing environmental organizations (Greenpeace and WWF) and the EU Commission for their stance on nuclear energy. The accusation is that these organizations and the EU are being hypocritical by labeling the pro-nuclear agreement as ""anti-science"" while allegedly failing to recognize the environmental impacts of other energy sources like solar and wind. The inconsistency being highlighted is between their professed commitment to science and environmental protection and their political stance against nuclear energy."

2,gpt4,"I've had this a lot too.  I don't get it.  I get downvoted to hell anytime I question someone on their climate change remarks or what they're doing for the environment.  It's very easy to say ""but climate change"" on the internet, but what I don't understand is how so many people because climate experts to the point that they know for sure to what degree it is happening and what the cause is.  If I point out that predictions made in the 90s have already turned out to be false, I get downvoted.  If I point out studies I've read that show that past temperature readings were inaccurate, and usually lower than than the actual figures, due to the placement of thermometers and how they estimated so much data, I get downvoted.  If I point out how tiny the time window spans of climate change data is, I get downvoted.  Climate change has been politically charged to the point that people who don't understand any of it speak with confidence as if they suddenly have a science degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Same for anti-Trumpisms.  I factually pointed out that migrants took the jobs where I grew up, got downvoted to hell and told that they can't steal jobs and no one wanted the jobs, blah blah blah.  OK, but suddenly everyone in certain jobs where I'm from are from Mexico and they will no longer hire you unless you speak Spanish, and we are over 1000 miles from Mexico, so that's BS, but OK, the migrants have nothing to do with the lack of job openings where I'm from. 

&amp;#x200B;

I point out how supposedly nice liberal policies fail in my city (NYC) and get downvoted to hell.  But the downvote doesn't change reality.  Prices for everything adjusted up when we raised our minimum wage, but some stores also closed, we have many empty storefronts here, and only chain stores are opening, because they're the only ones who can afford the PTO rule and insurance requirements and taxes and regulations and minimum wage rules here.  But when I make the obvious link between the hypocrisy of liberals saying they want to diminish the power of large businesses and them doing things that actually help large businesses, I get told it's all in my head, basically, even though loads of other people that have been here long term see the same thing.

But there is hope, we all can agree on basic things.  I said it was racist that the liberal school chancellor here wants to get rid of entrance exams so more black kids can get into elite schools, and I was expecting to get downvoted, but I actually did not.

&gt; TBF, he might be an honest climate sceptic (and have come to this conclusion after reading 200 book and having 'thought about it a lot TM' but his critiques are climate change issue are not novel, he strawmans any opposition, bases 'his ideas' on old debunked theories concocted by CRACKPOTS (geniuses in Peterson's own words), and he gives these ideas the extremely valuable (to the big end of town, whether Peterson gets a cut or not), maybe they just by a couple of truck worth of his books for compensation (obvious speculation, don't ask for proof) 'Peterson stamp of intellectual authority' which helps to legitimise and spread the 'argument' (justification for apathy/inaction) and plant them in the mind of a young voting age demographic who may otherwise care about climate change, but hate the SJW;s, and the Marxists, Post Modernists, Trans people, and anyone else they can label as a whinging SJW who is trying to spoil their fun and take their 'hard earned' and fair and rightful share of the world's resources the deserve as proportionate compensation for the value they alone as an individual have brought to the world (Don't include negative externalities in the equation though, that's some Post-Modernist, Marxist, insert whatever pejorative that makes you happy or sound smart, and helps you sleep. How dare they suggest I give up a fraction of what's mine it to someone less deserving than me, and god help anyone who tries to actually do it through policy reform/ tax rate adjustments/ carbon taxes etc. But I don't care about other taxes that don't negatively affect me directly, and hurt the most vulnerable (least deserving by natural order because something something lobsters). Now as an informed and obviously intelligent citizen (having read 12 rules for life qualifies me to that self appraisal, and 'understanding' Maps of meaning means I'm a freaking genius, plus I've got a pocket full of $5 words to spend if any doubts me or makes me doubt myself, but like many people with a little wealth, they don't quite know how to spend in a way that is concidered genuine to those with a little more wealth. Be Careful throwing around $5 words when you're not sure what the social value of doing so is, not aimed at you specifically OP, just a general piece of advice to cocksure young men).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, off to the polls I go to ensure my vote counts and the chances of the things I (Peterson et al.) want increase accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; So they'll ignore the climate change issue (or let it slide, perhaps with some other things they find hard to swallow), or give him a pass on that one because he has so much more of value to say. Then at election time they go to the polls and vote with Peterson having influenced their political priorities (and fucking identities in some cases). Of course it's not 'that simple' and I'm not suggesting everyone who reads the TL;DR on wiki, or buys his book, or donates to Patreon are all the same and behave the same. But I will say this, any one who thinks they're immune to the effects of propaganda are literally delusional and have a fuck load of hard and possibly painful work to do, and they certainly should not be relying on one (or a few) sources of information to do this.
&gt; 
&gt; A real education is a good foundation, which Peterson also devalues unless it's STEM with high income potential in an increasingly competitive and over-populated field, though He does value the trades (but who doesn't, besides a few boomers who wanted better for their children), so I'll give him credit there (but tradies aren't formally  trained to think critically enough to see through and oppose him, so of course he likes them).

Lie 1a. You can't just claim they don't have the money when they already twice (linked) demonstrated they DID have the money by sending the people to other camps with better services. The new and for-profits camps are paid $750-775 per child per night, there is no rational application of math that takes you from being paid $750 per night per kid to not affording soap, blankets, combs, toothpaste, and food. No, it's intentional.

&gt; Perhaps the democrats really do have a problem accepting facts. 

&gt; So you believe congress just passed an unnecessary billion dollar emergency funding bill for fun? You seem smarter than that. 

See: the two links that you ignored, it shows the opposite in both cases. Dems voted for bills in both houses allowing more aid because they can't directly control conditions. The Dem bill required conditions improved for the children with funds to help it pass. GOP bill gave no standards for care improvement and even had a rider for funds for Pentagon. I'd love to see how you spin that.

&gt; They wouldn't be there if congress hadn't passed the laws that Trump is enforcing. They wouldn't be there if there were less lawbreakers trying to game the system. There are a lot of scenarios. I don't accuse you of lying because you don't list them all.

Well thanks for not accusing me of lies whilst lying. When I said pre-Trump, I said it because of Trump. I meant what I said. Trump in April 2018 changed civil charges to criminal and detained asylum seekers. That wasn't through Congress. Trump changed protocol to allow detention of those who would not have been detained, and in doing so he created a legal violation through Flores. Congress got involved until Trump promised to not detain over the 20day deadline, but Trump's still doing it. Trump by rule is not ""enforcing"" the law, he changed DoJ policy and ended up VIOLATING the law.

&gt; if conjunction

It is what he said, it's what he's been saying, it's even what his team has been saying. Just a tip, this is a poor time to double down on the ""if"" as if Trump hasn't been calling conditions good if not perfect, given the Pence video from last night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B29-zYvMdAE&amp;feature=youtu.be Enjoy Pence saying to the press that ""each and every one of the children... and parents that I spoke to told me they were being treated well"" just after coming out of camps of 400 people packed with little space and lots of stench, and his own OIG report listing conditions failures. You can see on video exactly how he twisted it.

&gt; Secondly we don't really know how much the tax cut helped because the Fed rose interest rates. We do know they helped. Just not how much. 

You're hedging an ""I don't know"" on details between ""a little"" and ""not at all"" consequence of a $1.5 Trillion tax cut? Is that really the hill conservatives want to stand on?

&gt; I get that you really want to talk global warming. But it's only applicable in the conversation about Republicans refusal to accept facts. And I think you have demonstrated several times they do accept proven facts.

Taking credit for something others built that the right is [trying to kill](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-cuts-in-climate-change-research-spark-a-global-scramble-for-funds), while simultaneously being [unwilling to](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-budget-cut-clean-energy-programs#gs.p29d3u) produce [the spending](https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/aipcorp/images/fyi/fy20-trump-budget-request-summary.jpg) that would logically flow from if that said tech was actually a solution, is not accepting proven facts. What they describe as ""new"" is funding coal and nuclear, while cutting green research for CO2 reduction that you celebrated. That's not accepting facts, that's ignoring factual information if it doesn't support their conclusion.

&gt;  No. You tried to sidestep it. The next time there is a post about climate change in a liberal sub just drop a few facts about the dangers of green energy. I'm sure you will receive a lot of praise and adoration for bringing this environmental issue to their attention.

Fucking what? No really, please explain this better. The left is backing the research, as well as backing research to adjust for green tech risks, and you think referencing something that is already being dealt with is ""trying to sidestep?""

&gt; I'm just saying that California soccer mom who drives a prius and votes democrat also has strange views on vaccines. I'm sure you could Google Hollywood antivax for yourself. 

I did. The very first link was talking about the public partisan backlash against anti-vacc celebs. ""...In recent years, however, vaccine policy has taken on a partisan bent, with Republicans tending to favor looser immunization mandates, according to Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings School of Law in San Francisco who studies vaccine laws...In California, lawmakers have proposed tightening rules to make it more difficult for parents to obtain medical exemptions that allow them to keep their children unvaccinated...State Senator Richard Pan, the Sacramento-area Democrat who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, is a pediatrician with a master’s degree in public health. He lamented Ms. Biel’s foray into the political debate."" Oops? Want to try another?

&gt; Ok. And that applies to denying facts how? I clearly said both sides have corruption and cronyism. You seem to be the “not my tribe"" fact denier on this.

For one, because there's a difference between have and had, looking at your list. And because if group A has a little but is already permanently fixing it, and group B has a lot of it and won't fix it, that difference is important.

&gt; I believe you misunderstood the parable about hypocrisy. Hey I hear they tried to pass a law. Surely that ended the corruption. Did everyone hear about the fix before this?

They already passed it, with all Dems in favor and all GOP against. I also hope you have a better example than a Daily Caller cherrypick that ignores Trump's business dealings with Kennedy or [McConnell](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/387776-trump-nominates-mcconnell-brother-in-law-to-lead-pension-agency)'s/Trump's family nominations but does declare that Nelson making [an accusation](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18520387/russian-hackers-florida-county-voting-records-marco-rubio-presidential-election) is ""corruption.""

9,gpt4,"&gt;It's not hypocritical due to gender differences there are numerous cases where rules apply differently to men and women.

Lots of people have made this point.

&gt;[Hypocrisy...is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy)

End of discussion.

&gt;If a man has a certain reaction to a woman's behavior and other men share that sentiment then together they share that perspective.

Yes, they do. Many people share the perspective that black people are inferior beings, etc. That doesn't make them correct if they cannot back up their views in any valid way. You could state that a woman who was a virgin was a slut and then if men agreed on it then you would argue that it then has validity. It doesn't have validity.

&gt;I feel like our perspectives on dating and sleeping around in the 'contemporary climate' is different. I have female friends that go on a lot of dates, but don't sleep around. They take their dating lives seriously and often end up in LTRs. I also have female friends that are technically not slutting it up because they are having sex within the context of a 'relationship'. However, because they have a string of these short relationships it damages their reputation. I know a girl that every time I see her every few weeks she has a new boyfriend. It reached a point where I don't bother learning the names of these guys because the trend shows that they won't last. Her behavior has damaged her reputation in our social circle, and guys that know her as friends are less willing to take her seriously from what I hear.

Go to the top rated comment [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/5mz753/cmv_slut_shaming_is_primarily_a_f2f_issue/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=PurplePillDebate). Notice that the only RPer that responded to that was a woman because most RPers are too immature to take responsibility for their actions when they have real world consequences. They'd rather continue with their bullshit internet circle jerk.

&gt;The reason women are punished for this situation is because they are the ones that get hurt in these situations.

This is a ridiculous argument coming from anyone. But when it comes from RPers, who also advocate men sleeping around and avoiding commitment, while also claiming that they're somehow saving society by slut shaming, then it becomes literally absurd.

What you are effectively saying is that men should be rewarded for misleading women and women should be punished for being misled. And then RPers wonder why they're considered misogynists!

&gt;The argument that it's not an achievement is not used to refute the position that it is an achievement for women. It is used to support the argument that n-count/casual sex impacts women's and men's reputation differently.

Yes, but it's a bad argument because women extremely rarely set out with the intention of notching their bedpost in the first place. Women do not think it is an achievement to sleep around and they don't value it. So it therefore makes no sense to make this argument. It is spurious.

&gt;Because that is a personal standard, that is shaped by personal tastes and experience.

If you cannot reasonably agree on or even define something then the whole concept of referring to it as unhealthy is invalidated. Why is this unhealthy? Because I say that it is. What evidence do you have that it's unhealthy? None! Brilliant argument!

&gt;This dynamic is a little polarized, but in my experience it is pretty accurate. I hope my perspective will make sense to you when I contextualize it. The kind of advances people are talking about when it comes to plate-spinning and abundance mentality are low effort. Women that come to nightclubs and hook up with a guy who has attempted the same approach with 20 other girls in the same nightclub, does not create a valuable interaction for herself. In the eyes of a man that really like her this girl's value is downgraded from 'I should take her out to a nice dinner and that stuck-up bar that I don't really like but girls love it when you take them there' to 'I just have to say whatever that guy she's never met before said in a nightclub'. On the contrary high-value women will not accept this low effort approach, and for me that was a very frustrating lesson to learn. That when you reach a certain level being a player can actually be a detriment to getting into a relationship with a woman you really respect and desire. It doesn't mean she is only into chads, but she is not down to be with a guy who hits on everything that moves.

Slut shaming is a socially fabricated concept. Sex has no value other than what you afford it. Sex is arguably the most normal of all human behaviours, its why you're here and childbirth occurs in the first place. One might reasonably wonder why a demonised, filthy, taboo act leads to life itself. 

Yet, naturally enough, everyone wants to have sex. So you are invalidating something which is perfectly natural and merely following irrational dogma which has existed since human beings had all sorts of absurd beliefs that we would now view as laughable.

Sex is the number one underlying factor for human interaction, and absolutely the number one underlying component of dating. To ascribe people with a low valuation because they have sex is merely a superstition and in the cold light of day is completely lacking in logic.

&gt;I don't think it's shaming for sharing your personal preferences, that is taking it a little too far.

I have said over and over again that people's preferences are their own preferences and no-one can change that. I never made any statement about people's preferences. This has nothing to do with slut shaming, which is...

[A form of social stigma applied to people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate traditional expectations for sexual behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming). As I've explained previously, those traditional expectations don't make any sense, and indeed RPers have already completely rejected them for men.",0,True,1,The commenter is accusing RPers (Red Pillers) of advocating for men to sleep around and avoid commitment while simultaneously slut-shaming women for similar behavior.

The accusation is focused on personal moral behavior and standards related to sexual conduct.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/jon-stewart-veterans-burn-pits-gop-cruelty/?utm_source=reddit.com

&gt;Senate Republicans last week provided Americans with a vivid example of their party’s abject cruelty when they rejected the PACT Act, which would provide veterans with benefits to cover the health consequences they endured from exposure to burn pits while serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. They did so even though many of those same Republicans approved a nearly identical bill in June.

&gt;For a tutorial on how to respond to the lies and heartlessness Republicans have shown here, Democrats should turn to an unlikely source: comedian Jon Stewart.

&gt;The GOP’s reversal on the bill seems to be motivated by payback. Republicans voted against the PACT Act because they were angry over the agreement between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the Inflation Reduction Act, the reconciliation package that includes tax hikes on the wealthy, subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage and investment in green energy. The deal was announced just hours after the Senate passed its bipartisan bill to enhance national security and U.S. competitiveness against China by investing in semiconductor manufacturing.

&gt;Jon Stewart joined Democratic lawmakers in the District on July 28 after Senate Republicans blocked a new plan to help millions of veterans. (Video: The Washington Post)
In other words, Republicans threw a temper tantrum because they would no longer be able to hold the semiconductor bill hostage to block passage of the Democrats’ popular agenda. Think about that for a second. Republicans took their frustrations with Democrats out on sick veterans. That’ll show them!

&gt;In the days since the GOP stalled the bill, Stewart was unflinching. He went in front of cameras on Thursday to express what many Americans were feeling. Regarding Republicans’ about-face on the bill, Stewart said he was used to the “hypocrisy,"" “lies” and “cowardice” of politicians, but “I am not used to the cruelty.”

&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) offered a patently false excuse that the bill would create “pork.” In fact, the funds are delineated for a specific purpose. As Stewart tweeted: “The PACT Act is a stand alone bill. The PACT Act has no spending unrelated to Veteran’s Health and Benefits. There is no ‘Pork.’ There is no budget maneuver that then allows Dems to backfill [with] whatever they want.”

&gt;Stewart, appearing on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, kept up the barrage:

 
&gt;Republicans will likely come crawling back to approve the bill now that they have been exposed as deceitful, malicious and petulant. But Democrats should learn from Stewart and apply his techniques in other contexts.


&gt;In the abortion realm, Democrats should be clear. It is the height of dishonesty to say that abortion bans, which would endanger women’s health and lives, are “pro-life.” And it is simply untrue that these bills are about preventing abortions moments before delivery, as so many Republicans claim. The Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban third-trimester abortions. All but a handful already did before the Dobbs decision. One percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks and far fewer in the third trimester. It is a lie to say abortion causes women emotional distress or physical injury or that abortion is dangerous.

&gt;And it is cruel and barbaric to demand that a teen rape victim endure pregnancy and labor or to demand a woman with chronic health conditions risk pregnancy. Only monsters would insist that doctors wait until women are so sick that they might die before they can receive appropriate medical treatment, which includes abortions.

&gt;Stewart is a gifted communicator. His basic approach — righteous anger, blunt language, mastery of the facts, determination to call out the GOP’s bad faith — is something all Democrats should follow, whether the topic is veterans’ health, abortion, the Jan. 6 insurrection, guns, climate change or just about anything else. Enough is enough.

You might want to also look up the explosion in the rate of diabetes among the populations of countries where grains make up the majority of their daily caloric intake. Human beings aren't meant to survive on on a diet consisting primarily of complex carbs. Yes it's possible to do so but it causes serious health problems in the long run.

As I said, yes the planet needs to reduce its meat consumption but that isn't far off from the current consumption levels overall. The majority of meat consumed is concentrated in certain countries but if those were reduced and everyone was to eat balanced diets.

30,gpt4,"# “A Huge Mistake.” The E.U. Jeopardizes its Climate Goals By Labeling Natural Gas as Green

By *Ciara Nugent*

A long-simmering debate about the future of natural gas has been forced to a head in Europe this month, as the E.U. considers classifying some projects involving the fossil fuel as sustainable investments in official advice for the private sector due to be published by the end of January.


Burning natural gas produces carbon dioxide—but around 50% less than burning coal. The E.U. gets 22% of its energy from natural gas, and to meet its ambitious climate targets, the European Commission says it needs to cut use of the fuel by 37% by 2030. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, says the world needs to stop all investment in new gas and oil projects from 2021 onwards in order to keep on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050.


So it surprised many when, on Dec. 31, a draft version of the E.U.’s green energy taxonomy—a long-awaited list of investments the bloc considers sustainable for the planet—said that natural gas projects should count as green under certain conditions. (Nuclear energy, which does not emit greenhouse gases but carries other environmental risks, also got a controversial inclusion).


On. Jan 12, a coalition of influential investors including BlackRock, Vanguard and most of the world’s largest asset managers sent an open letter to E.U. representatives urging them to rethink the inclusion of natural gas in the taxonomy. “It is our view that the proposals in the [draft] would seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance, potentially triggering a ‘race to the bottom’,” the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change wrote, “which could dilute the level of climate ambition within emerging jurisdictional taxonomies.”


With the private sector trying to overhaul its spending to meet a deluge of environmental pledges made in recent years, the goal of the taxonomy is to guide money to the right places and hasten the energy transition.


The taxonomy, a technical document, has become a political battleground for warring visions between member states over the future of natural gas. One side—including many Central and Eastern European countries and Italy—argues that Europe needs to invest more in natural gas as a “bridge fuel” from even-dirtier coal and oil to a fully clean energy future. The other side—including Sweden, Austria, Spain, Ireland and others—says that the E.U. needs to discourage investment in all fossil fuels including gas inside its borders, and instead channel every available resource into ramping up renewables, which make up only around 17% of Europe’s energy supply.


The debate has divided the E.U.’s two largest economies. Germany’s government, a coalition including the Green party, has said the draft taxonomy amounts to “greenwashing,” while France has backed it, largely because it includes nuclear energy, the country’s main energy source.


The draft text has sparked fierce backlash from environmentalists across the bloc, who warn that the E.U.’s green credentials for gas—even with conditions attached—will have implications far beyond the natural gas market in Europe, confusing investors around the world and providing cover for the fossil fuel industry in developing countries.


”As a bloc, we are losing a lot of the legitimacy we need to convince others to shift their policies in order to achieve climate sustainability,” says Mounir Satouri, a Green member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France. “This is a huge mistake.”


## The case for natural gas as a transitional fuel

Wind and solar power are becoming very cheap to install, but we still lack some of the technology to store their energy for longer periods when the wind isn’t blowing or sun isn’t shining. Advocates for natural gas argue that it’s easy to store, and power plants running on the fuel can be turned off and on as needed, making it a great complement to renewables for the next decade or so.


The E.U.’s taxonomy labels natural gas as a “transitional fuel,” and investments in it will count as green if power plants produce emissions below 270g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour and are equipped to burn lower carbon gases, such as green hydrogen. Any new natural gas project must also replace a more polluting fossil fuel plant, and receive a construction permit by Dec. 31, 2030.


The green label “will certainly unlock some investment. But that will be very focalized in those markets where there’s still quite a lot of reliance on coal: in central and eastern Europe and perhaps Germany,” says Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of global gas research at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.


The E.U. aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 in order to stay on track to avoid the worst of climate change. Classing some natural gas as green is a pragmatic decision to help coal-reliant member states shift off coal more quickly and meet that target, according to Christian Ehler, a German MEP from the center-right European People’s Party. “Poland is not jumping from coal to wind [turbines]—there will be a step in between. So politically there needs to be a compromise,” he says. “If a national energy mix includes gas in order to fulfill the 55% ambitions, why should that harm either the environment or the commonly formulated goals? I think this politics of symbolism has to come to an end if you really want to reach those goals.”


## Muddying the green waters

But environmentalists reject the idea that natural gas is needed as a bridge fuel. “This transitional mentality arguing in favor of ‘less bad’ energy forces could have worked a couple of decades ago,” says Jakop Dalunde, a Green MEP from Sweden. “But today, in a climate emergency, we have to have full focus on energy sources that are truly sustainable.”


Granting natural gas a “green stamp,” he adds, could divert money from investments in clean energy—a problem, given renewables capacity needs to expand by 12% ever year to stay on track for net zero at 2050, per the IEA. “This [taxonomy] is about the long-term future we want to encourage. Fossil fuels have no place there.”


Though the taxonomy includes fairly stringent conditions for natural-gas projects to be classed as green, campaigners are concerned that it will be difficult to hold projects accountable for meeting them, says Tsvetelina Kuzmanova, a sustainable finance policy advisor at European climate think tank E3G. For example, power plants would need to switch to 100% low-carbon gases by 2035 under the rules, but the technology does not yet exist to run a gas power plant only with low carbon gases, so it is unclear how a gas project seeking green funding in the present would prove it can eventually do that.


Kuzmanova says that any expansion of natural gas poses a threat to the E.U.’s short-term goal on methane—a potent greenhouse gas with 80 times the warming power of CO2—which is the main component of natural gas. At COP26, the U.N. climate conference last November, the E.U. pledged to cut its methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Leaks from natural gas infrastructure are one major source of methane emissions, while the rest mostly come from agriculture. “Reducing natural gas infrastructure really should be the low-hanging fruit on methane,” Kuzmanova says.


## The impact beyond Europe

Climate campaigners also worry about the wider signal that the move sends on the urgency of phasing out gas. The E.U. has presented itself as a climate leader for the world in recent years, says Marie Toussaint, a Green MEP from France. “If we then say natural gas can be a sustainable investment, the message that other countries get is that it’s still okay to keep producing gas for many years,” she says, adding that other governments may follow the E.U.’s example but fail to impose the same limiting conditions on gas investments.


Analysts say policy makers in South Korea followed the E.U.’s discussion closely when drafting their own sustainable energy taxonomy, published in December, which also classifies natural gas as a transitional fuel.


And, though the taxonomy is meant only as advice to the private sector, Toussaint says she sees its influence in other E.U. legislation that lawmakers are reviewing as part of the European Green Deal. The European Investment Bank also aligns its lending with the taxonomy.


For Dalunde, the Swedish MEP, a taxonomy that includes natural gas is a wasted opportunity to deliver the level of climate ambition the world urgently needs. “This taxonomy had the potential to be one of the most consequential decisions that we take on climate change, not only for Europe, but globally, because other nations will take inspiration from it,” says Dalunde. “It could have been a quiet revolution. But the inclusion of fossil gas would really undermine that.”",0,False,2,"The article discusses the European Union's decision to label natural gas as a green investment, which is seen as contradictory to its climate goals. The accusation is that the E.U. is jeopardizing its climate goals by making a decision that appears to be inconsistent with its professed commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is a clear example of political hypocrisy, as it involves a gap between the E.U.'s stated environmental policies and its actions."

What about rising cost of living? Affordable housing? Work life balance? Pressure to be succesful? 

Korean millennials refer to themselves as part of the Sampo generation, a neologism that translates to the “three sacrifice generation” – one where young Koreans feel like they must give up relationships, marriages and children to survive the cut-throat economy. 

The Sampo generation quickly becomes the n-generation with n stands for the increasing additional numerous sacrifices (homeownership, etc.), not just 3, 4 or 5.

BTS, for a short period of time, was part of the President envoy. They could use this opportunity to have a meaningful discussion with Predisent Moon about the various issues that Korean youths are facing.

Or 2. Albums and photobooks don't have as much negative impacts as fossil fuel, deforestation or carbon omission. Go after the ones that have the big impact. Well, NFTs are lot worse for the environment than photobooks. But now we can't fight NFTs either because your fave suddenly support NFTs?

&gt;The investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows foreign corporations bypass U.S. law

I hate this argument!!!! ISDS doesn't allow corporations to challenge laws they disagree with. It gives corporations the power to stop countries from violating the free trade agreements. Without an enforcement mechanism, we can't have free trade.

For example, in the 1990's Canada banned the import of a harmful gasoline additive called MMT. The ban was challenged by an American company and was successful. The reason for the challenge was not the ban on the chemical, it was challenged because Canadian companies were allowed to keep selling it while Mexican and American companies could not. This violated NAFTA, and without provisions like ISDS, there is no way to challenge unfair treatment. Without it, there is no point in having a FTA. 

&gt;Does not require all countries to be in full compliance with international labor standards

What it does is enforce higher labor standards than currently exist in developing countries. We give them an incentive to improve. I'm sorry, but you can't expect developing countries to have the same standards as the developed. By making this a condition, you are effectively hindering their economic opportunity. Access to the American Market, economic growth and increased wealth are the best way to improve labor standards and living standards. By asking for first world standards, you are effectively banning them from competing, making the poor poorer, and doing nothing to improve the situation.

I have lost all respect for Germany and their stupid ""green"" propoganda.",0,False,2,"The commenter is accusing Germany of hypocrisy for opposing nuclear energy on ideological grounds while using gas, which they argue is worse for the environment. This highlights a perceived inconsistency between Germany's professed commitment to clean energy and their actual energy choices. The accusation is political because it involves the actions and policies of a nation-state in the context of energy policy and environmental ideology."
43,gpt4,"Many people are against climate change, child labor, wage exploitation, etc. yet still buy products that contribute to these issues. Much of it is unnecessary too. Is this hypocrisy? Why can't someone want a product from a certain industry but also be against certain practices within the industry?",0,True,1,"The commenter is pointing out a perceived inconsistency between people's professed beliefs (being against climate change, child labor, wage exploitation) and their consumer behavior (buying products that contribute to these issues). The question ""Is this hypocrisy?"" suggests that the commenter is considering this behavior hypocritical. The focus is on personal moral choices and consumer behavior, making it an accusation of personal moral hypocrisy."
44,gpt4,"I believe that there are a mix of factors taking place here. The most significant factor, and in my opinion the most reasonable, is a general lack of action over climate change. The scientific facts about climate change have been well understood since the 80s, at the latest. I think a lot of younger people feel that baby boomers just kicked the can down the road to them instead of making some hard decisions or sacrifices to slow or prevent climate change. 

The rest of the complaints I see are pretty stereotypical and less grounded in reality. I think there are some very strong criticisms of political policies that the boomer generation has enacted, but many boomers opposed those policies all along, so that's a difficult comparison to make. 

Also, I think some younger people feel that there is a good deal of hypocrisy amongst boomers with regard to things like technology. For example, you can look at the /r/boomerhumor subreddit and see lots of jokes about how young people are on their phones a lot, but I think older people have a lot of screen time as well. I don't know if that is specific to boomers, though.

Lastly, and I realize this has become a weird list, there was a level or privilege that many boomers had that they don't acknowledge. For example, look up the number of hours it took at minimum wage to pay for college in the 70s, and compare that to now. It makes it very frustrating to see when boomers try to, say, oppose minimum wage increases or student loan forgiveness. They benefited from a whole set of policies that they are now trying to prevent younger generations from accessing.",0,True,2,"The comment discusses various factors contributing to generational tensions, particularly focusing on the perceived hypocrisy of the baby boomer generation. The key point of hypocrisy is the accusation that boomers benefited from certain policies (e.g., affordable education, economic privileges) but now oppose similar benefits for younger generations (e.g., minimum wage increases, student loan forgiveness). This is a political hypocrisy accusation because it involves a gap between the political actions and policies supported by the boomers and the benefits they themselves received."
45,gpt4,"&gt;Sorry, I keep forgetting that young people no longer value using their own brains to form opinions

Yeah I forgot oldies tend to just cook up bullshit from the sky and call it facts and opinions. Guess that's why climate change is in such a denial for them. 

&gt;And I would think that perhaps a person who's prone to hiding their welfare status might also be prone to continuing to oppose the program in spite of their own use

And just like I call AOC at the Met Gala a hypocrite, I'd call that welfare receipent too.",0,True,2,"The commenter is accusing AOC (a political figure) of hypocrisy for attending the Met Gala, which is perceived as inconsistent with her political stance or image. The mention of a welfare recipient is also an accusation of hypocrisy, but it is tied to political actions or stances (opposing welfare programs while using them). Both instances involve a gap between professed political beliefs and actions."
46,gpt4,"Because western climate change rhetoric is purely political and zero action oriented. The EV subsidies are only going to manufacturers with lobbying power, the personal responsibility myth is endlessly perpetuated, when farting cows emit more greenhouse gasses than all consumer cars. The politicians want to divert blame to china and india when they in aggregate (USA and CAD) have emitted more since 1800s than everyone else combined.

Western politicians go tout climate action while riding there on private jets and holding lavish parties.

Yes I believe mercer doesn't in his mind refute it. He is probably deeply conservative and cynical, likely believing the hypocrisy of the rest justifies his negative actions. It's a fallacy, but he clearly has a more complex thought process than the housepoor simpleton redditors on this thread who believe science is a religion.",0,True,2,"The commenter is accusing Western politicians of professing concern for climate change while engaging in actions that contradict this stance, such as providing subsidies to manufacturers with lobbying power, perpetuating the personal responsibility myth, and using private jets.

48,gpt4,"&gt;He is a person who claims to be for transparency in politics. This would be more believable if he wasn't so partisan about his support, but alas it is what it is

I don't follow this point at all. Why would transparency mean supporting both parties? That reasoning doesn't track

&gt;The hard left in American like to scream about money in politics so when the hard Right does the same thing, those on the left can't deal with their hypocrisy so they say things like ""Soros is Jewish, that's why conservatives hate him.""

The hard left isn't liberals or Democrats, you are mixing diverse groups into one side. And while Soros donates he doesn't specifically fund pure unadulterated bullshit like the Koch Brothers do for anti climate change stuff. The other Koch brothers support is problematic, but it's their anti science linked donations that are the real problem people have with their political advocacy. 

Conservatives do not villify or treat other Democratic promoting billionaires the same way. Even though Bezos runs the WaPo and gets shit on for not supporting Trump. There isn't a wide ranging set of conspiracy theories about how he brings down governments and hates ""the West"". Soros is straight up treated differently than other non Jewish billionaires.",0,True,2,"The comment contains an accusation of hypocrisy directed at the ""hard left"" in America. The commenter suggests that the hard left criticizes money in politics but cannot handle similar criticism when it comes from the hard right, implying a double standard. This is a political hypocrisy accusation because it deals with the inconsistency between the hard left's professed political values (opposing money in politics) and their reaction to similar actions by the hard right."
49,gpt4,"The Democrat's 'Green New Deal' called for the elimination of air travel within 10 years.  If you believe in climate change and that we all need to radically shift our behavior, how could anyone justify flying somewhere for non-essential reasons?  

I see way too many hypocrites here and among the wealthy.  Remember when DiCaprio flew his private jet from Sydney to NYC so he could experience 2 new years in 1 night? 

Personally, I don't believe any of this will matter until the big emitters like China radically change their behavior.  That is the real threat.",0,True,2,"The commenter is accusing Democrats and wealthy individuals of hypocrisy. The inconsistency is between their professed beliefs (radical behavior change to combat climate change) and their actions (flying for non-essential reasons, exemplified by DiCaprio's private jet use). The mention of the ""Green New Deal"" and the focus on political figures and policies indicate that the primary accusation is political hypocrisy."
50,gpt4,"I don't get why people are so hypocritical about this crap... You can't criticize a denier for saying ""it snowed alot this wonter so climate change is fake,"" and then when we have a warm winter cry out ""omg see its proof of climate change""... ",0,True,2,"The commenter is accusing people of being hypocritical in their arguments about climate change, specifically pointing out an inconsistency in how they interpret weather patterns to support their stance. The accusation is about the inconsistency in the political argumentation and rhetoric used to support the belief in climate change, rather than personal behavior."
51,gpt4,"As another put it in a different thread:

""Tax money is always confiscation by threat of physical violence. If we are truly (insert moral here. in this case: helping the poor), we should open up our wallets in our community and make the change, not petition politically self interested dictatorial potentates to confiscate it at the tip of a rifle in order to enforce our moral consciences.""

in the end, you're right in this: many christians, including myself, sometimes miss out on the opportunity to help others and care less about our own well-being. I'll add further that you can find hypocrisy in *all* christians. But that's because it's what we are *by definition*: we hold to a moral code that we are unable to keep perfectly ourselves; we're sinners and we have to recognize and repent of our sins all the days of our lives. It is a never ending battle made worse by the social climate that encourages selfishness and greed.",0,True,1,"The commenter acknowledges that Christians, including themselves, often fail to live up to their moral code, which is a form of personal moral hypocrisy. They explicitly state that ""you can find hypocrisy in all Christians"" because they hold to a moral code they cannot keep perfectly. This is a clear admission of a gap between professed beliefs (Christian moral code) and personal behavior (failing to keep the moral code)."
52,gpt4,"Typical shitlib brainworms. Read what [Greta said.](https://youtu.be/pHLVDlb6rCU) It doesn't fucking exclude the SNP or the Greens for that matter who are just as complicit as any other world leader beholden to finance and business elites.

&gt;It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure. It should be obvious that we cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place. Many are starting to ask themselves, “What will it take for the people in power to wake up?”  
&gt;  
&gt;But let’s be clear: They are already awake. They know exactly what they are doing. They know exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to maintain business as usual. The leaders are not doing nothing; they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system. This is an active choice by the leaders to continue to let the exploitation of people and nature and the destruction of present and future living conditions to take place.  
&gt;  
&gt;The COP has turned into a PR event where leaders are giving beautiful speeches and announcing fancy commitments and targets, while behind the curtains the governments of the Global North countries are still refusing to take any drastic climate action. It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo.  
&gt;  
&gt;And COP26 has been named the most exclusionary COP ever. This is not a conference. This is now a Global North greenwash festival, a two-week-long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah. The most affected people in the most affected areas still remain unheard, and the voices of future generations are drowning in their greenwash and empty words and promises. But the facts do not lie, and we know that our emperors are naked.  
&gt;  
&gt;To stay below the targets set in the Paris Agreement, and thereby minimizing the risks of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control, we need immediate, drastic, annual emission cuts unlike anything the world has ever seen. And as we don’t have the technological solutions that alone will do anything even close to that, that means we will have to fundamentally change our society. And this is the uncomfortable result of our leaders’ repeated failure to address this crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the current emissions rates, our remaining CO2 budgets to give us the best chances of staying below 1.5 degrees Celsius will be gone within the end of this decade. And the climate and ecological crisis, of course, doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is directly tied to other crises and injustices that date back to colonialism and beyond, crises based on the idea that some people are worth more than others, and therefore had the right to steal others — to exploit others and to steal their land and resources. And it is very naive of us to think that we could solve this crisis without addressing the root cause of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not going to be spoken about inside the COP. It’s just too uncomfortable. It’s much easier for them to simply ignore the historical debt that the countries of the Global North have towards the most affected people and areas. And the question we must now ask ourselves is: What is it that we are fighting for? Are we fighting to save ourselves and the living planet, or are we fighting to maintain business as usual?",0,False,2,"The comment and the quoted speech by Greta Thunberg accuse political leaders and parties (including the SNP and the Greens) of professing to care about climate change while continuing to support policies and actions that benefit business elites and maintain the status quo.

Fuck her. If she was so concerned she'd be sweating at the idea of millions of magazines being printed. She's useless.",0,True,1,The commenter is accusing a specific individual (a 16-year-old climate activist) of being a hypocrite.
