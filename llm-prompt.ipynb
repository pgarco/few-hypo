    "        **Hypocrisy Accusation Classification codebook**\n",
    "        Accusations of hypocrisy are when someone accuses someone or something of being a hypocrite because of a moral contradiction between what they profess and their actions or words.\n",
    "        Accusations of hypocrisy are sometimes direct such as ``You are a hypocrite'' and sometimes are understood via context, such as when a celebrity is called out for using a private jet while publicly claiming the need for climate action.\n",
    "        Usually these accusations are done by using words that highlight the moral inconsistency or contrast between what people profess or claim their believe and what people actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Steps*:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. You will analyze a Reddit Comment and evaluate if there is an accusation of hypocrisy.\n",
    "        2. You will make sure to consider contextual factors, implications, and rhetorical devices to make sure things such as irony or double meaning are taken into account.\n",
    "        3. You will label each comment as ``No accusation'' or ``Hypocrisy accusation''.\n",
    "        4. If a comment is labeled as ``Hypocrisy accusation'' then, you will assign one of following labels according to the hypocrisy accusation type:\n",
    "        A) ``Personal moral hypocrisy'': gap between personal behavior and professed beliefs.\n",
    "        B) ``Political hypocrisy'': gap between professed beliefs, values, or ideology and policy or political action.\n",
    "        C) ``Neither''\n",
    "        \n",
    "        *Important*\n",
    "        Be sure to not misunderstand reported speech. You need to find direct accusations of hypocrisy in the comment, not descriptions of accusations made by someone else.\n",
    "        When determining the type of hypocrisy, the primary consideration is the content of the targeted action/statement/position.\n",
    "        For instance, consumer choices typically indicate personal moral hypocrisy, while explicitly political action such as voting or protesting indicates political hypocrisy.\n",
    "        If the content is unclear, the type of actor being accused can guide the decision: accusations against nations or governments are usually political, whereas accusations against private citizens are typically personal.\n",
    "        Consider all the rhetorical devices.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        *Examples*:\n",
    "        Comment: Yea the greens preferred Brown coal over nuclear energy and now they're crying around about air pollution.\n",
    "        Label: Hypocrisy accusation, Political hypocrisy\n",
    "        \n",

    "        Label: No accusation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        *Remember*\n",

Your task is to labels Reddit comments following the instructions below:\\n\\n**Instructions**\\nAccusations of hypocrisy are when someone accuses someone or something of being a hypocrite because of a moral contradiction between what they profess and their actions or words. Accusations of hypocrisy are sometimes direct such as \\\"You are a hypocrite\\\" and sometimes are understood via context, by highlighting a connoted inconsistency between what people profess or claim their believe and what people actually do. An example would be criticizing a celebrity for using a private jet while publicly claiming the need for climate action.\\nThere are different types of hypocrisy accusations, such as accusing someone of personal moral hypocrisy or accusing someone of political hypocrisy. The primary consideration to decide the accusation type is the content of the targeted action, statement or position. For instance, consumer choices typically indicate personal moral hypocrisy, while explicit political action such as voting or protesting indicates political hypocrisy. If the content is unclear, the type of actor being accused can guide the decision: accusations against nations or governments are usually political, whereas accusations against private citizens are typically personal.\\n\\n**Classification steps**\\n1.  You will analyze a Reddit Comment and evaluate if there is an accusation of hypocrisy.\\n2. You will make sure to consider contextual factors, implications, and rhetorical devices to make sure things such as irony or double meaning are taken into account. \\n3. You will assign a label to the comment: \\\"Not an accusation\\\" or \\\"Hypocrisy accusation\\\".\\n4. If the label is \\\"Hypocrisy accusation\\\", then you will analyze what type of accusation it is: \\n1) \\\"Personal moral hypocrisy\\\": a gap between personal behavior and professed beliefs\\n2) \\\"Political hypocrisy\\\": a gap between professed beliefs, values, or ideology and policy or political action. \\n3) \\\"Neither\\\" \\n5. Then you will assign a second label to the hypocrisy accusations: \\\"Personal moral hypocrisy\\\", \\\"Political hypocrisy\\\" or \\\"Neither\\\". \\n\\nChoose the most appropriate label, and remember to consider all the rhetorical devices.\"\n",

Accusations of hypocrisy are sometimes direct such as \u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\\"\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43mYou are a hypocrite\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\\"\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43m and sometimes are understood via context, by highlighting a connoted inconsistency between what people profess or claim their believe and what people actually do. An example would be criticizing a celebrity for using a private jet while publicly claiming the need for climate action.\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\n\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43mThere are different types of hypocrisy accusations, such as accusing someone of personal moral hypocrisy or accusing someone of political hypocrisy. The primary consideration to decide the accusation type is the content of the targeted action, statement or position. For instance, consumer choices typically indicate personal moral hypocrisy, while explicit political action such as voting or protesting indicates political hypocrisy. If the content is unclear, the type of actor being accused can guide the decision: accusations against nations or governments are usually political, whereas accusations against private citizens are typically personal.\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\n\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\n\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43m**Classification steps**\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\n\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43m1.

The inconsistency being alleged in this allegation stems from personal lifestyle choices - choice of commute, i.e. not taking a train.\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\n\u001b[1;32m    124\u001b[0m \u001b[43m          \u001b[49m\u001b[43m}\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    125\u001b[0m \u001b[43m        \u001b[49m\u001b[43m]\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    126\u001b[0m \u001b[43m      \u001b[49m\u001b[43m}\u001b[49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\u001b[43m \u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    127\u001b[0m \u001b[43m      \u001b[49m\u001b[43m{\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    128\u001b[0m \u001b[43m        \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mrole\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m:\u001b[49m\u001b[43m \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43muser\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    129\u001b[0m \u001b[43m        \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mcontent\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m:\u001b[49m\u001b[43m \u001b[49m\u001b[43m[\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    130\u001b[0m \u001b[43m          \u001b[49m\u001b[43m{\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    131\u001b[0m \u001b[43m            \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mtype\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m:\u001b[49m\u001b[43m \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mtext\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    132\u001b[0m \u001b[43m            \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mtext\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m:\u001b[49m\u001b[43m \u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mf\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43mLabel the next comment:\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;130;43;01m\\n\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;132;43;01m{\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[43mi\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;132;43;01m}\u001b[39;49;00m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\"\u001b[39;49m\n\u001b[1;32m    133\u001b[0m \u001b[43m            \u001b[49m\u001b[43m}\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    134\u001b[0m \u001b[43m        \u001b[49m\u001b[43m]\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    135\u001b[0m \u001b[43m      \u001b[49m\u001b[43m}\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    136\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43m]\u001b[49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    137\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43mtemperature\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m0\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    138\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43mmax_tokens\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m200\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    139\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43mtop_p\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m1\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    140\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43mfrequency_penalty\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m0\u001b[39;49m\u001b[43m,\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    141\u001b[0m \u001b[43m    \u001b[49m\u001b[43mpresence_penalty\u001b[49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m=\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;241;43m0\u001b[39;49m\n\u001b[1;32m    142\u001b[0m \u001b[43m  \u001b[49m\u001b[43m)\u001b[49m\n\u001b[1;32m    143\u001b[0m   x \u001b[38;5;241m=\u001b[39m response\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39mchoices[\u001b[38;5;241m0\u001b[39m]\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39mmessage\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39mcontent\n\u001b[1;32m    144\u001b[0m   results_2\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39mappend(x)\n",

Your task is to labels Reddit comments following the instructions below:\\n\\n**Instructions**\\nAccusations of hypocrisy are when someone accuses someone or something of being a hypocrite because of a moral contradiction between what they profess and their actions or words. Accusations of hypocrisy are sometimes direct such as \\\"You are a hypocrite\\\" and sometimes are understood via context, by highlighting a connoted inconsistency between what people profess or claim their believe and what people actually do. An example would be criticizing a celebrity for using a private jet while publicly claiming the need for climate action.\\nThere are different types of hypocrisy accusations, such as accusing someone of personal moral hypocrisy or accusing someone of political hypocrisy. The primary consideration to decide the accusation type is the content of the targeted action, statement or position. For instance, consumer choices typically indicate personal moral hypocrisy, while explicit political action such as voting or protesting indicates political hypocrisy. If the content is unclear, the type of actor being accused can guide the decision: accusations against nations or governments are usually political, whereas accusations against private citizens are typically personal.\\n\\n**Classification steps**\\n1.  You will analyze a Reddit Comment and evaluate if there is an accusation of hypocrisy.\\n2. You will make sure to consider contextual factors, implications, and rhetorical devices to make sure things such as irony or double meaning are taken into account. \\n3. You will assign a label to the comment: \\\"Not an accusation\\\" or \\\"Hypocrisy accusation\\\".\\n4. If the label is \\\"Hypocrisy accusation\\\", then you will analyze what type of accusation it is: \\n1) \\\"Personal moral hypocrisy\\\": a gap between personal behavior and professed beliefs\\n2) \\\"Political hypocrisy\\\": a gap between professed beliefs, values, or ideology and policy or political action. \\n3) \\\"Neither\\\" \\n5. Then you will assign a second label to the hypocrisy accusations: \\\"Personal moral hypocrisy\\\", \\\"Political hypocrisy\\\" or \\\"Neither\\\". \\n\\nChoose the most appropriate label, and remember to consider all the rhetorical devices.\"\n",
