2,llama,"Ok, you made your point, but I have some misgivings about your words (which I've addressed at the end of this response).

I 100% agree with you that Trump is a fascist and is a Russian plant, that his administration has had involvement with Russia. That's undisputed at this point, and what he's done to the EPA is nothing short of obscene.

If Trump knew the pandemic was dangerous but did nothing, and committed politicized, he is beyond evil and a mass murderer (something I've already concluded months ago-- for fuck's sake if I was still Catholic I would have called him the literal Antichrist, and yet he's led astray so many supposed ""Christians"").

The whole thing about the right's rage over Obama is idiotic, and I agree. So many people still (falsely) believe that Obama is Muslim, or that he wasn't born in the US, or that he's a thousand other unsubstantiated things. Many Republicans hate and speak badly of Obama likely just because he's black, and I have family who somehow believe Obama is a Communist when there is zero evidence this is the case, and deny climate change, and say racial slurs.

&gt;For one you can look at the criminal records of all Republican leadership and you will find that they have committed crimes, especially sex crimes with underage children, at more then 4 times(4 times!) The rate that democrat leadership has. If you've never looked at this before you will be absolutely shocked: dozens and dozens and dozens of Republicans in power right now from mayors to governors to congressman have been convicted of raping and molesting and even trafficking children. This is factually not true about the Democrat side of the aisle.

I had no idea so many Republicans were literally child molesters, but I need to see some sources to back up this particular claim, because I can't just take your word without *reputable, unbiased, or minimally biased* sources. It's obvious nowadays that so many Catholic priests or clergy are child molesters, and it's truly sickening that the Vatican/the Church had these priests transferred to other parishes for decades, and not arrested for their crimes. Rather than admit the truth, they chose to hide pure evil under the rug. So much for preaching goodness and holiness. A lot of Hollywood directors, actors, and powerful people are also child molesters or rapists-- and many of them are liberal or lean liberal. But with Republican politicians I draw a blank-- I'm not well versed in the sheer number of pedophile Republicans you claim exist. The only connection I can make is Epstein, because he had connections with many politicians and powerful people on both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump, the Clintons, etc.

If you are correct and can prove your assertions, it's ironic that so many far-right loonies accuse Democrats of leading a pedophile ring (PizzaGate, QAnon, etc), when they themselves are the pedos. It's a classic case of projection.

Edit: I've checked on some sites and some people say that there are just as many Democrat child molesters as Republicans, and mention Jared Fogle and other liberals who also molested kids, but I have had trouble finding a definitive list of Democrats guilty of child abuse. Even if there are 4 times as many Republicans who are guilty of child molestation in comparison to Democrats, as you assert, this shouldn't minimize the guilt and culpability of Democrats who are also culpable of the same crimes, even if incidences of sexual crimes among Dems is comparatively less common or smaller.

Pedophilia exists on all sides of the political spectrum and (should) be considered a non-partisan issue. I think what makes Republicans worse off in this regard is their hypocrisy and excessive religiosity-- they preach moral family values and to follow Jesus but then do horrible things when no one's looking. So not only are Republican pedos disgusting, but they're also liars and hypocrites.

I don't know. I'm open to your thoughts. That list of Republicans is horrifying.

To compare, Bill Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky, sure, but at least she was of legal age, and (supposedly) it was consensual, yet many on the right who accused him of immorality themselves were having affairs with other women or men.

4,gpt4,"First, reducing ""luxury"" by a few dozen percent from the top 2% of the world population  isn't going to to do jack shit and if you think it will you haven't looked at the problem in any real depth. 

Second, the actual protesters haven't done any of what is remotely necessary even if you believe that a reduction in luxury will somehow change the climate trajectory. Any single protester that eats mass-produced food or has a smartphone above $100 is a hypocrite. Which they 99% are.

Meaning, third, there is no way to change the lifestyle without forcing someone to do it. Are you going to be the one doing the forcing? Well, guess what -- you try forcing someone to do anything they don't want and you'll get a 12-gauge up your ass.

5,gpt4,"&gt; Hypocrisy may be greater though, as is vapid self entitlement, such as for example, claiming they are ""more empathic"" while behaving like insane selfish parasites - while they pat their own back and paint themselves as better then those other generations.

You might be right. But the baby boomers in political power sure demonstrate these traits as well.

&gt; The climate change issue is the same, actually. Sure the ""younger generations"" protest more about it, but are they actually doing anything about it? Protesting is nice, its like a party really. And you have someone else to blame - again, for everything, including the fault of why those protesting parties dont work.

I agree, we aren't really doing anything that's helping. But we are trying despite general exhaustion with the state of the world (and draconian restrictions put in place by those in power. In Australia, there are laws that restrict protests).

Are baby boomers doing anything? Did I miss something?

&gt; I wonder how much of the environment feels any of you would have when actual restrictive measures would be taken and so reductions of life style. Besides, are we talking about western relatively rich and well positioned younger generations or the whole world? 

Lots of younger people, including myself, are adopting a life of minimalism and would prefer say, living in a repurposed shipping container over owning a mansion.

&gt; If we are talking about US - well, younger generation there just had the rare opportunity to elect a truly progressive and just candidate which would surely beat Trump in next elections and they have totally failed to even fucking vote. But complaining on the internet about it? Mmm-mm. From the fucking couch. 

I'm in Australia, but am following the US situation. I am appalled that Bernie is not SMASHING the polls. I blame the established Deep State for keeping someone like Biden in the running, in conjunction with the mainstream media's clearly biased coverage. Are you also forgetting the fact that older generations get to vote too?

Bless Eric and the rest of the pirate radio movement for trying. Oh yeah - that seems to me like a damn good effort on the side of Millenials in answering your previous question (see Red Scare podcast, FriendlyJordies (Australian political commentator), and more).

&gt; On the whole though, i dont think you can make any relevant judgement or evaluations of personality traits and qualities based on such generalizations. The real differences are in individuals, and always have been.

Sure - whatever you want to believe. I'm just trying to push this conversation forward without doing what you're doing: ""Yeah you guys aren't doing anything either, so shut up and just let the world continue to go to shit"". Bad argument imo with no evidence, anecdotal or reliable.

This is just my perspective from the front lines as a frustrated but hopeful Millenial. I do think you are right here to a large extent (being that things are largely individual). But younger generations are learning at an exponential rate how to be moral and contribute to society (thanks to technology and people like Eric, Joe Rogan, etc. [And please don't argue that Rogan is detrimental to society as some kind of alt. right figure - man's an international treasure]). I consider myself to be one of these Millenials.
