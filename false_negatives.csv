1,llama,"It does seem that our views are somewhat in alignment, definitely. 

The place we probably mainly diverge is in what we think are the biggest threat and most effective levers, which for me are greenwash/techno-optimism and behavioural change/regulation respectively. The world has lots of people in it who want to do the right thing for the planet and who are willing to make sacrifices to a certain extent and vote for the right policies. Greenwash and false technical solutions neutralise and misappropriate this good will. For example people will pay extra for something to be green, but for almost everything labelled green/eco/sustainable, it’s a lie currently. 

Key disagreements as I understand them are:
- getting off fossil fuels, in my opinion, *isn’t* worth it if the solution is more damaging.
- creating biofuels does not get us off fossil fuels, it merely adds to them. Anti-fossil fuel regulation is the only way to “break the chain”, but as long as the industry can promise that they’ll act without the need for regulation, then they can dupe us into thinking it’s not necessary which brings me to my next point about industry promises
- the industry’s net zero by 2050 forecast for SAFs can be summarised as follows: do almost nothing for 15 years then miraculously ramp up “sustainable” fuel production for just-in-time net zero at 2050. This will mean that by the time we hit 2035 and reach this fabled ramp up, and we finally realise that it is totally unachievable, and worse for the planet, it’ll be too late. In parallel all current company execs will have comfortably retired and shareholders will have already made a tidy sum of money from the preceding 15 years of business as usual. 
- I also disagree with the notion that we can’t expect rapid change. This is one of the fossil fuel industry’s favourite narratives to spread, and it has been working for the last several decades as they’ve dragged their feet as much as possible. People in face to face conversations and in Reddit threads should stop reinforcing this narrative since it is self fulfilling. 

My solutions are as follows: educate people that, contrary to what adverts tells us, new technology and innovations from large companies cannot alone invent us out of a climate catastrophe. This means getting really tough on greenwash and false techno-optimistic solutions which should also help create an appetite for strong regulation. It also means stopping the focus of sustainability being on how much green stuff you do, but instead on how much not green stuff you don’t do. It seems simple, but the narrative almost always centres around, for example, more electric cars, more electric planes, more solar panels, rather than fewer petrol cars, less coal. One more electric car ≠ one less petrol one. Only one less petrol car = one less petrol car. The alternative could be anything or nothing, but the environment only cares about the reduction GHGs. E.g. I could have a fleet of 5 petrol cars. That’s 100% petrol cars. I could then buy 10 EVs (sounds great) and now I’m at 33% petrol cars (also sounds great), but no improvement to combating climate change has been made. So that’s why I call this kind of publicity out as the greenwash it is. In terms of technically what needs doing, we need to curb growth in flying and start flying less, unfortunately. The day flying can be truly green will be 30+ years at least from now. At that point maybe it can have a renaissance.

Realistically, how does that work? Any products his farm produced would be vastly more expensive than anyone else's. He'd give up his slaves, lose his wealth and influence, and end up a morally upstanding person who was no longer of consequence. The dude died in *massive* debt, so if he gave up his slaves and all his property, he'd have been destitute and likely wind up debtor's prison, basically a slave himself.

It strikes me as kind of ignorant, at best, to not consider the facts here. You condemn Jefferson as being a hypocrite for being against slavery yet not freeing his slaves.    
How about *you* though? You use computers, smart phones, and other products which are almost certainly made with some form of forced labor. You eat foods picked by underpaid migrant workers or outright slaves. You very likely ride or drive in personal vehicles and eat meat, despite knowing that those things contribute to climate changes.     
Do you want to solve homelessness? Why not give all your money to homeless shelters and go live in one yourself?    
Why don't you give up all your possessions and comforts, and live the most simple life you can in service to others?     
  
Would those personal actions actually help anything though, or would you just be one weirdo who basically can't function in your community because of your moral absolutism?   
    
This is the kind of bullshit argument that people use to prevent progress. Claim someone is a hypocrite, and use that to discredit the validity of the changes they want.    
It's a fucking catch 22. If you're a ""have"" and advocate for change, then you're a hypocrite; if you're a ""have not"" and advocate for change, then you're just a bitter nobody, so why should anyone listen?   
No one is allowed to advocate for change except some impossibly pure saint.   
  
     
You, me, and nearly everyone are no more than one step removed from contributing to the evils of our own time. You're not morally indemnified just because you aren't *personally* enslaving the West African children who harvest the cacao of the chocolate you eat.   
The fact is that we are all held hostage to the social and economic realty of the day. No matter what, even as you try to change things, you may have to engage in the same evils you decry.   
  
There's a reason why people advocate for *government* solutions. When it's a matter of the law, it puts everyone on even ground. It means that *no one* is benefiting from slave labor. It means that *every* business you compete with has to pay the minimum wage. It means that *everyone* has to pay X amount of taxes.   
   
Was Jefferson a financial idiot and spoiled elitist? Unarguably.    
Is it really reasonable to ask a person to give up everything they have and send themselves into destitution based on moral grounds? Not really. If you think it is, *you do it first*.

9,gpt35,"**ExxonMobil loses bid to dismiss AG Healey's climate change lawsuit**

Massachusetts’ highest court on Tuesday rejected a bid by ExxonMobil to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the state that accuses the oil giant of misleading the public about the role its fossil fuels play in causing climate change.

The lawsuit filed in 2019 by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey alleges Exxon launched an effort, “reminiscent of the tobacco industry’s long denial campaign about the dangerous effects of cigarettes,” to deceive consumers and investors about climate change.

Massachusetts’ Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling that rejected the company’s argument that a state law shielded it from the lawsuit.

A phone message seeking comment was left with Exxon, which has denied spreading disinformation about the contribution of fossil fuels to global warming.

In a congressional hearing last year, the company's CEO, Darren Woods, told lawmakers that its public statements on climate “are and have always been truthful” and that Exxon has “long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change” and ""devoted significant resources to addressing those risks.″

The Massachusetts lawsuit says Exxon engaged in a “sophisticated, multi-million dollar campaign” to sow doubt in climate science and downplay the link between fossil fuels and climate change. The lawsuit says Exxon also undertook “greenwashing campaigns” in an effort to portray itself as environmentally responsible.

“Rather than honestly disclose and mitigate climate change risks, ExxonMobil’s misrepresentations about and failures to disclose those risks have delayed the needed transition to clean energy around the world and make these existential climate-driven threats to the global economy more likely to occur,” the complaint says.

Healey called the court's ruling a “resounding victory” in the state's efforts to “stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers.”

“Exxon’s repeated attempts to stonewall our lawsuit have been baseless, and this effort was no different. We look forward to proceeding with our case and having our day in court to show how Exxon is breaking the law and to put an end to the deception once and for all,” she said in a statement.

Lawyers for Exxon argued in court documents that the company’s statements about climate change and energy policy were “protected petitioning activity” even if they were made to defend the company’s reputation.

But the top court said the law Exxon claimed should protect the company in this case doesn't apply to government enforcement actions brought by the attorney general.

It's the latest twist in years long battle between Massachusetts and Exxon. The company previously unsuccessfully sued Massachusetts in an effort to block Healey's investigation into Exxon and climate change.",2,False,0,The comment provides a summary of a legal battle between ExxonMobil and the state of Massachusetts regarding allegations of misleading the public about climate change.

26,gpt35,"&gt; Hypocrisy may be greater though, as is vapid self entitlement, such as for example, claiming they are ""more empathic"" while behaving like insane selfish parasites - while they pat their own back and paint themselves as better then those other generations.

You might be right. But the baby boomers in political power sure demonstrate these traits as well.

&gt; The climate change issue is the same, actually. Sure the ""younger generations"" protest more about it, but are they actually doing anything about it? Protesting is nice, its like a party really. And you have someone else to blame - again, for everything, including the fault of why those protesting parties dont work.

I agree, we aren't really doing anything that's helping. But we are trying despite general exhaustion with the state of the world (and draconian restrictions put in place by those in power. In Australia, there are laws that restrict protests).

Are baby boomers doing anything? Did I miss something?

&gt; I wonder how much of the environment feels any of you would have when actual restrictive measures would be taken and so reductions of life style. Besides, are we talking about western relatively rich and well positioned younger generations or the whole world? 

Lots of younger people, including myself, are adopting a life of minimalism and would prefer say, living in a repurposed shipping container over owning a mansion.

&gt; If we are talking about US - well, younger generation there just had the rare opportunity to elect a truly progressive and just candidate which would surely beat Trump in next elections and they have totally failed to even fucking vote. But complaining on the internet about it? Mmm-mm. From the fucking couch. 

I'm in Australia, but am following the US situation. I am appalled that Bernie is not SMASHING the polls. I blame the established Deep State for keeping someone like Biden in the running, in conjunction with the mainstream media's clearly biased coverage. Are you also forgetting the fact that older generations get to vote too?

Bless Eric and the rest of the pirate radio movement for trying. Oh yeah - that seems to me like a damn good effort on the side of Millenials in answering your previous question (see Red Scare podcast, FriendlyJordies (Australian political commentator), and more).

&gt; On the whole though, i dont think you can make any relevant judgement or evaluations of personality traits and qualities based on such generalizations. The real differences are in individuals, and always have been.

Sure - whatever you want to believe. I'm just trying to push this conversation forward without doing what you're doing: ""Yeah you guys aren't doing anything either, so shut up and just let the world continue to go to shit"". Bad argument imo with no evidence, anecdotal or reliable.

This is just my perspective from the front lines as a frustrated but hopeful Millenial. I do think you are right here to a large extent (being that things are largely individual). But younger generations are learning at an exponential rate how to be moral and contribute to society (thanks to technology and people like Eric, Joe Rogan, etc. [And please don't argue that Rogan is detrimental to society as some kind of alt. right figure - man's an international treasure]). I consider myself to be one of these Millenials.

28,gpt35,"Ok, you made your point, but I have some misgivings about your words (which I've addressed at the end of this response).

I 100% agree with you that Trump is a fascist and is a Russian plant, that his administration has had involvement with Russia. That's undisputed at this point, and what he's done to the EPA is nothing short of obscene.

If Trump knew the pandemic was dangerous but did nothing, and committed politicized, he is beyond evil and a mass murderer (something I've already concluded months ago-- for fuck's sake if I was still Catholic I would have called him the literal Antichrist, and yet he's led astray so many supposed ""Christians"").

The whole thing about the right's rage over Obama is idiotic, and I agree. So many people still (falsely) believe that Obama is Muslim, or that he wasn't born in the US, or that he's a thousand other unsubstantiated things. Many Republicans hate and speak badly of Obama likely just because he's black, and I have family who somehow believe Obama is a Communist when there is zero evidence this is the case, and deny climate change, and say racial slurs.

&gt;For one you can look at the criminal records of all Republican leadership and you will find that they have committed crimes, especially sex crimes with underage children, at more then 4 times(4 times!) The rate that democrat leadership has. If you've never looked at this before you will be absolutely shocked: dozens and dozens and dozens of Republicans in power right now from mayors to governors to congressman have been convicted of raping and molesting and even trafficking children. This is factually not true about the Democrat side of the aisle.

I had no idea so many Republicans were literally child molesters, but I need to see some sources to back up this particular claim, because I can't just take your word without *reputable, unbiased, or minimally biased* sources. It's obvious nowadays that so many Catholic priests or clergy are child molesters, and it's truly sickening that the Vatican/the Church had these priests transferred to other parishes for decades, and not arrested for their crimes. Rather than admit the truth, they chose to hide pure evil under the rug. So much for preaching goodness and holiness. A lot of Hollywood directors, actors, and powerful people are also child molesters or rapists-- and many of them are liberal or lean liberal. But with Republican politicians I draw a blank-- I'm not well versed in the sheer number of pedophile Republicans you claim exist. The only connection I can make is Epstein, because he had connections with many politicians and powerful people on both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump, the Clintons, etc.

If you are correct and can prove your assertions, it's ironic that so many far-right loonies accuse Democrats of leading a pedophile ring (PizzaGate, QAnon, etc), when they themselves are the pedos. It's a classic case of projection.

Edit: I've checked on some sites and some people say that there are just as many Democrat child molesters as Republicans, and mention Jared Fogle and other liberals who also molested kids, but I have had trouble finding a definitive list of Democrats guilty of child abuse. Even if there are 4 times as many Republicans who are guilty of child molestation in comparison to Democrats, as you assert, this shouldn't minimize the guilt and culpability of Democrats who are also culpable of the same crimes, even if incidences of sexual crimes among Dems is comparatively less common or smaller.

Pedophilia exists on all sides of the political spectrum and (should) be considered a non-partisan issue. I think what makes Republicans worse off in this regard is their hypocrisy and excessive religiosity-- they preach moral family values and to follow Jesus but then do horrible things when no one's looking. So not only are Republican pedos disgusting, but they're also liars and hypocrites.

I don't know. I'm open to your thoughts. That list of Republicans is horrifying.

To compare, Bill Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky, sure, but at least she was of legal age, and (supposedly) it was consensual, yet many on the right who accused him of immorality themselves were having affairs with other women or men.

We hardly know it exists. The closest we ever see is when a company greenwashes itself by saying it's ""sustainable"". However, if you check out what they do, they aren't sustainable at all. Greenwashing is a great marketing tool.

0,gpt4,"It does seem that our views are somewhat in alignment, definitely. 

The place we probably mainly diverge is in what we think are the biggest threat and most effective levers, which for me are greenwash/techno-optimism and behavioural change/regulation respectively. The world has lots of people in it who want to do the right thing for the planet and who are willing to make sacrifices to a certain extent and vote for the right policies. Greenwash and false technical solutions neutralise and misappropriate this good will. For example people will pay extra for something to be green, but for almost everything labelled green/eco/sustainable, it’s a lie currently. 

Key disagreements as I understand them are:
- getting off fossil fuels, in my opinion, *isn’t* worth it if the solution is more damaging.
- creating biofuels does not get us off fossil fuels, it merely adds to them. Anti-fossil fuel regulation is the only way to “break the chain”, but as long as the industry can promise that they’ll act without the need for regulation, then they can dupe us into thinking it’s not necessary which brings me to my next point about industry promises
- the industry’s net zero by 2050 forecast for SAFs can be summarised as follows: do almost nothing for 15 years then miraculously ramp up “sustainable” fuel production for just-in-time net zero at 2050. This will mean that by the time we hit 2035 and reach this fabled ramp up, and we finally realise that it is totally unachievable, and worse for the planet, it’ll be too late. In parallel all current company execs will have comfortably retired and shareholders will have already made a tidy sum of money from the preceding 15 years of business as usual. 
- I also disagree with the notion that we can’t expect rapid change. This is one of the fossil fuel industry’s favourite narratives to spread, and it has been working for the last several decades as they’ve dragged their feet as much as possible. People in face to face conversations and in Reddit threads should stop reinforcing this narrative since it is self fulfilling. 

My solutions are as follows: educate people that, contrary to what adverts tells us, new technology and innovations from large companies cannot alone invent us out of a climate catastrophe. This means getting really tough on greenwash and false techno-optimistic solutions which should also help create an appetite for strong regulation. It also means stopping the focus of sustainability being on how much green stuff you do, but instead on how much not green stuff you don’t do. It seems simple, but the narrative almost always centres around, for example, more electric cars, more electric planes, more solar panels, rather than fewer petrol cars, less coal. One more electric car ≠ one less petrol one. Only one less petrol car = one less petrol car. The alternative could be anything or nothing, but the environment only cares about the reduction GHGs. E.g. I could have a fleet of 5 petrol cars. That’s 100% petrol cars. I could then buy 10 EVs (sounds great) and now I’m at 33% petrol cars (also sounds great), but no improvement to combating climate change has been made. So that’s why I call this kind of publicity out as the greenwash it is. In terms of technically what needs doing, we need to curb growth in flying and start flying less, unfortunately. The day flying can be truly green will be 30+ years at least from now. At that point maybe it can have a renaissance. As you can see, it’s not a terribly optimistic view, but at least it might help us avoid the worst of the climate catastrophe.
